We still have the iPhone X in perfect condition. \n\n3 Weeks in, her phone slipped out her pocket from our dining chair to the concrete floor with Spigen case on. We weren’t worried as the drop was from a pretty low height but lo and behold! \n"

Am having issues reasoning with myself at the moment. \n\nI really want to upgrade to the iphone 17 pro, but my iPhone 11 (256gb)is still running great. I replaced the battery this time last year and only just above 100gb of storage at any given time. So there is no compelling reason to upgrade, but I am itching for something new. \n\nOn paper the 17 series is a massive jump in performance, but I kind of already have the foresight that my overall user experience won't be dramatically different other than a bigger prettier screen, but I still can't help myself.\n\nI think I should just buy the phone and return it once I confirm my thoughts. See I told you I am not thinking rationally right now. Maybe I should just buy myself a new case..\n\nOh, and I would have to replace the lightning cables in my house, car, and office, but it would be nice to have all my devices run on USB C.  🤔"

While I appreciate the fact that these updates are being given at all, I was worried that the same may happen with the 17 in 4 years, while I would like to get 5-7 out of it. I don't care about features as much as I do speed and stability.\n\nTo those of you have have used Android (especially OnePlus), how would longevity compare? Torn between these two at this point."

Won’t power on, forced reset won’t work, trying to connect to iTunes won’t work. It is just a brick. Not sure if it’s something to avoid doing but as a precaution I would highly recommend not broadcasting your phone onto the tv while it is charging.\n\nI have an appointment with Bestbuy tomorrow to get it checked out.

        "selftext": "I see so many people who are upset with the new Pro design and colors, but hear me out! We’re used to seeing people getting “the best iPhone” every year (which is the Pro models), so everyone knows they spent money without using most of the features. That is why the new Pro is industrial and objectively doesn’t look as aesthetically pleasing. I love the orange, but I can see how the new design and feel doesn’t appeal to those who like sleek minimalism. The new Pro is clearly about functionality and is marketed to people who will use it with that in mind: creatives, content creators, travel bloggers, tech enthusiasts etc.\n\nAn average corporate Joe doesn’t need 8 camera lenses and the capabilities of Pro. And given the state of the economy, I think they know that most people will be upgrading less in the future. Apple wants people to stick with the base model or push the average consumer towards the Air, which is cheaper to make and will still satisfy the needs of most. Those models still have the desired minimalist design. \n\nMost people don’t need the Pro, so I don’t understand the outrage. Just think about how often you do more with that camera than taking a photo of your pet or a selfie? Instead of overpaying for Pro because “it’s Pro”, people should just get the base model. It’s a win-win situation."

        "selftext": "I saw some review videos where people were already using thermal cameras to check the iPhone 17’s battery temperature. That made me curious since I had done similar tests myself. In this thermal comparison, the 16 Pro/Max showed surface temps around 42 to 43°C, while the 17 Pro/Max stayed closer to 37 to 38°C. I remember testing my coworkers’ phones at the office with a thermal camera. Most of them looked fine, but my 14 Pro was the hottest. By touch the difference was not huge, but once the case was off the heat became much more obvious.\n\nThermal imaging only shows surface temperature, but it clearly reveals where the heat builds up and how it spreads across the device. From these numbers, the 17 series has made a big improvement in thermal management. I wonder if any 17 users here can share whether it actually feels cooler in daily use."

Thought about maybe going to the Apple Store and seeing if I can get an exchange since I wanted Orange, not a pink IPhone. "
