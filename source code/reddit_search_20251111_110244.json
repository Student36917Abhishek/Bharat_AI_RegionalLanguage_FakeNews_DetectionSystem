        "selftext": "It seems like every election cycle, we see the same result: a decisive win for the Trinamool Congress. \n\nBut I've been thinking, is this a wholehearted endorsement of TMC's governance, or is it more of a strategic vote against the Bharatiya Janata Party?\nLet's be honest, the TMC is far from perfect. We all know about the allegations of corruption, syndicate raj, women safety and strong-arm tactics that have plagued their tenure. Many of us have personally experienced or seen the impact of these issues.\n\nHowever, when the alternative is the BJP, it feels like many Bengalis are stuck between a rock and a hard place. There's a strong perception that the BJP is a party of \"outsiders\" with a political and cultural agenda that is alien to Bengal. Their brand of Hindutva politics, while successful elsewhere, often clashes with the more syncretic and culturally nuanced fabric of our state. The fear is that if the BJP comes to power, they might try to impose a monolithic culture that could erode our unique Bengali identity, which has a rich history of its own.\n\nThis leads to the \"lesser of two evils\" argument. Are people voting for TMC not because they are the best choice, but because they are the only viable force to keep the BJP at bay? It feels like a defensive vote, a choice to stick with the devil you know rather than risk a perceived greater threat to our cultural ethos.\n\nFinally I’m not some elitist who votes for TMC but denies when asked so yes currently I vote for TMC since I don’t want my vote to go to the party that ain’t gonna win at all and I don’t vote BJP since my ideologies are different from what the party believes. \n\nI'm curious to know what you all think. Is this a fair assessment of the political landscape in West Bengal? Or are there other factors at play that I'm missing? May be schemes like kanyashree? Is the support for TMC more robust than this \"lesser evil\" theory suggests?"

Chief Minister Heman Soren has led the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha to victory in thirty-four seats out of eighty-one seats in the Vidhan Sabha, up four from 2019, and 23.44% of the vote, up 4.72%.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party has come in second place with twenty one seats (down four) despite winning 33.18% of the vote (down 0.19%), the largest of any single party in the state election.\n\nThe Indian National Congress, part of the Mahagathbandhan, won sixteen seats (unchanged from 2019) and 15.56% of the vote (up 1.68%).\n\nThe Rashtriya Janata Dal, also part of INDIA and the Mahagathbandhan, won four seats (up three) with 3.45% of the vote (up 0.7%).\n\nAnother INDIA and Mahagathbandhan member, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation won two seats (up one) and 1.89% of the vote (up 0.74%).\n\nNDA members All Jharkhand Students Union Party, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and Janata Dal (United) won a seat each, down one for the AJSUP and up one for LJP(RV) and JD(U).\n\nThe non-aligned Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha, contesting its first Assembly elections, won a single seat, while the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) and Nationalist Congress Party, which gained three and one seat respectively at the 2019 elections failed to take anything this time around, and two independents who also held seats previously failed to gain any.\n\n**Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha election results:**\n\nThe Mahayuti has won the election in a landslide, gaining a total of 236 seats (up 31) to the Maha Vikas Aghadi's 50 (down 24).\n\nThe BJP has won 132 seats (up 27), Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena 57 (up 19), the Nationalist Congress Party 41 (unchanged), the JSS 2 (up 1), the RYSP 1 (unchanged) and the RSVA 1 (up 1).\n\nIn the MVA, the INC has won 16 (down 28), a crushing defeat after the strong results in the Lok Sabha election and a blow to the MVA's hopes of forming a government. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has won 20 (up 5) and the National Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) 10 (down 5). The Samajwadi Party has won 2, the People's Workers Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) 1, all three unchanged from their previous results.\n\nTwo independent candidates have won seats, including one that is in the Mahayuti, down from 13, the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen 1 (unchanged) and the Rashtriya Yuva Swabhiman Party has also won 1.\n\n*Lok Sabha Bypolls:*\n\nPriyanka Gandhi of the INC has won in Wayanad (Kerala), with the party also retaining Nanded (Maharashtra).\n\n*State Bypolls:*\n\nThe NDA-aligned Sikkim Krantikari Morcha has retained both Sikkim bye-elections uncontested.\n\nThe National People's Party, also an NDA member, has won the sole Meghalaya bye-election seat. It was held by the INC until the member was elected to the Lok Sabha, and the INC failed to retain it at the bye-election.\n\nCongress has won all three seats in the Karnataka bye-elections. Two of them were previously held by NDA parties, the BJP and Janata Dal (Secular), strengthening Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's state government.\n\nThe BJP has retained the one Uttarakhand Assembly seat in the bye-election.\n\nThe NDA has won all four seats in the Bihar bye-elections, with the BJP gaining one from the CPI(ML)L and one from the RJD, and the JD(U) also gaining one from the RJD.\n\nThe INC and CPI(M) have both retained the seats they held earlier in the Kerala bye-election, with the BJP's early lead in Palakkad disappearing, leaving the party with no seats in the state assembly. The respective strengths of the UDF and LDF in the Niyamasabha are unchanged.\n\nThe ruling Aam Aadmi Party has won three of four seats in the bye-elections to the Punjabi Assembly. This comes as a blow to the INC Opposition, which previously held all three of those seats. However, the INC has itself won 1 seat from the AAP.\n\nThe sole Gujarat seat in the bye-election, one of the few INC seats in the BJP-ruled state, was lost to the BJP despite the INC leading in the seat for most of the morning.\n\nThe BJP has retained the only seat going up for bye-election in Chhattisgarh, despite suffering a small negative swing of a little over 4%\n\nThe All-India Trinamool Congress has won a massive victory in the West Bengal bypolls, sweeping all six seats including one formerly held by the BJP, with massive margins in most and an positive average swing of over 14%, and up to 26.66% in one seat. The results have strengthened Mamata Banerjee's ministry in the aftermath of issues such as floods and the RG Kar incident. This marks the biggest victory of any INDIA coalition party in the bye-elections.\n\nThe NDA has won all five Assam bye-election seats. The BJP retained two, and NDA allies United People's Party Liberal and Asom Gana Parishad retained one each. The BJP also flipped one seat from the INC.\n\nThe BJP and INC have won one seat each in Madhya Pradesh, with each seat previously held by the respective party.\n\nThe BJP has won 5 of 7 seats in Rajasthan with INDIA Opposition parties INC and BAP winning 1 each. The BJP has flipped three seats from Congress and one from their INDIA ally, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, while also retaining one of their own seats. The INC and BAP have retained one each. After Maharashtra, Rajasthan is perhaps the biggest victory for the BJP.\n\nThe BJP has won two seats from the Samajwadi Party and retained two. It has also contested and won one formerly held by NDA ally NISHAD Party. The Samajwadi Party has retained two seats, while BJP ally Rashtriya Lok Dal has retained one seat. Overall, the NDA has won 7 out of 9 seats in the UP bye-elections, including flipping two from the SP+ Opposition, a massive reverse of SP's performance in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n**Bypoll election results:**\n\n*Assam (5 seats)*\n\nAsom Gana Parishad (NDA, Government) - 1\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 3\n\nUnited People's Party Liberal (NDA, Government) - 1\n\n*Bihar (4 seats)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 2\n\nHindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (NDA, Government) - 1\n\nJanata Dal (United) (NDA, Government) - 1\n\n*Chhattisgarh (1 seat)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 1\n\n*Gujarat (1 seat)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 1\n\n*Karnataka (3 seats):*\n\nIndian National Congress (INDIA, Government) - 3\n\n*Kerala (2 seats)*\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) (INDIA, state level: Left Democratic Front, Government) - 1\n\nIndian National Congress (INDIA, state level: United Democratic Front, Opposition) - 1\n\n*Madhya Pradesh (2 seats)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 1\n\nIndian National Congress (INDIA, Opposition) - 1\n\n*Meghalaya (1 seat)*\n\nNational People's Party (NDA, state level: Meghalaya Democratic Alliance, Government) - 1\n\n*Punjab (4 seats)*\n\nAam Aadmi Party (INDIA, Government) - 3\n\nIndian National Congress (INDIA, Opposition) - 1\n\n*Rajasthan (7 seats)*\n\nBharat Adivasi Party (INDIA, Opposition) - 1\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 5\n\nIndian National Congress (INDIA, Opposition) - 1\n\n*Sikkim (2 seats, uncontested)*\n\nSikkim Krantikari Morcha (NDA, Government) - 2\n\n*Uttarakhand (1 seat)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, government) - 1\n\n*Uttar Pradesh (9 seats)*\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (NDA, Government) - 6\n\nRashtriya Lok Dal (NDA, Government) - 1\n\nSamajwadi Party (INDIA, state level: SP+, Opposition) - 2\n\n*West Bengal (6 seats)*\n\nAll-India Trinamool Congress (INDIA, Government) - 6"

Not by accident, but by design.\n\nLet’s take a step back and look at what’s actually happening. The BJP, which claims to be the main opposition in Bengal, has somehow managed to position itself in a way that actively alienates Bengali voters. Whether it’s through loud cultural posturing, the obsession with non-issues, or the repeated anti-Bengali dog whistles — none of this looks like serious politics. It looks like they’re trying to lose.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets disturbing. This doesn’t feel like a blunder anymore. This feels intentional. This feels like a calculated sacrifice. If you’ve followed the narrative carefully, the so-called anti-Bengali campaign they’ve allowed to fester in their own circles isn’t just stupid — it’s almost strategic. They know how Bengalis will react. They know this narrative won’t sell. But they’re running with it anyway.\n\nIt's time to form a alternate party. It's time Bengali Hindus must fend for themselves and not depend on BJP anymore."
