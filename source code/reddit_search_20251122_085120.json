This purchase will mark the first export agreement fulfilled with fighter jets manufactured by India itself.\n\n**RUSSIA TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE SALE**\n\nThe new aircraft are planned to be equipped with the Uttam AESA radar, indigenous electronic warfare systems, and Astra Mk.1 and Mk.2 air-to-air missiles. However, it is reported that some of these systems are still under development.\n\nAlthough a high degree of indigenous production is targeted, some critical components used in the aircraft will be sourced from Russia. This means Moscow will continue to earn revenue from the sale.\n\n**DELIVERIES TO BE COMPLETED BY 2029**\n\nDeliveries are scheduled to begin in 2027 and be completed by 2029. According to defense experts, this process will be a significant milestone for India's defense industry.\n\n\n\n[https://thedefensepost.com/2025/10/31/armenia-india-su30mki-deal/](https://thedefensepost.com/2025/10/31/armenia-india-su30mki-deal/)\n\n\n\n**General overview and specs**\n\n# Astra Mk1 (Currently in Service)\n\nThe Astra Mk1 is India's first indigenous Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air missile. It is designed to engage and destroy highly maneuverable supersonic aerial targets.\n\n* **Role:** Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVRAAM)\n* **Range:** **80-110 km** (The range varies based on launch altitude and profile). It is effective at both long ranges and in close-combat scenarios.\n* **Guidance:** **Mid-course:** Inertial Navigation System (INS) with data link. **Terminal:** Active Radar Homing.\n   * The active radar seeker allows the missile to find and lock onto its target independently in the final phase, enabling \"fire-and-forget\" capability for the launch aircraft.\n* **Propulsion:** Single-stage solid propellant rocket motor.\n* **Speed:** Mach 4.5+ (High supersonic)\n* **Warhead:** High-explosive pre-fragmented warhead with a proximity fuse.\n* **Maneuverability:** Equipped with tail controls for high agility and can pull over 40g, allowing it to engage even highly maneuverable fighter aircraft.\n* **Compatibility:** Integrated on the Su-30MKI. Cleared for integration with Tejas, Mirage 2000, and Mig-29 fighters.\n\n# Astra Mk2 (In Advanced Development)\n\nThe Astra Mk2 is a significant upgrade over the Mk1, featuring a dual-pulse solid rocket motor for better energy management and a much longer range.\n\n* **Role:** Long-Range, Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (LR-BVRAAM)\n* **Key New Feature:** **Dual-pulse solid rocket motor.**\n   * This motor fires in two stages. The first pulse boosts the missile to a high speed, then it coasts towards the target, and the second pulse ignites in the terminal phase for a high-energy, no-escape-zone engagement.\n* **Range:** **Over 160 km** (Estimated to be 160-180 km).\n* **Guidance:** Improved INS with a two-way data link and a more advanced active radar seeker.\n* **Speed:** Mach 5+ (Hypersonic)\n* **Maneuverability:** Even greater agility than the Mk1, expected to handle targets pulling higher g-forces.\n\n# Astra Mk3 (Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet - SFDR)\n\nThe Astra Mk3, part of the SFDR program, is a technological leap that will place India among a small group of nations with such advanced missile technology.\n\n* **Role:** Very Long-Range, Air-to-Air Missile\n* **Key New Feature:** **Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR) Propulsion.**\n   * A ramjet engine uses atmospheric air for combustion, making it far more fuel-efficient than a traditional rocket motor. This allows for sustained high speed and much greater range without a proportional increase in size and weight.\n* **Range:** **Over 300 km** (Estimated to be 340+ km). This puts it in the class of missiles like the Meteor.\n* **Speed:** Sustained high supersonic/hypersonic speed throughout its flight.\n* **Advantage:** The SFDR propulsion gives the missile immense kinetic energy in the terminal phase, creating a very large \"no-escape zone\" where enemy aircraft cannot outrun or outmaneuver it.\n\n# Summary Comparison\n\n|Feature|**Astra Mk1**|**Astra Mk2**|**Astra Mk3 (SFDR)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Role**|BVRAAM|Long-Range BVRAAM|Very Long-Range Missile|\n|**Range**|\\~110 km|\\~160 km|**300+ km**|\n|**Propulsion**|Single-stage Solid Rocket|**Dual-pulse** Solid Rocket|**Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet**|\n|**Key Advantage**|Proven \"Fire-and-Forget\"|Better energy management for longer range|Sustained speed & massive no-escape zone|\n|**Status**|**In Service**|Advanced Development|Technology |\n\n\n\n\n\n# Su-30MKI: General Overview\n\nThe Su-30MKI is a twin-seat, twin-engine, heavy-class, multirole air superiority fighter.

        "selftext": "#A Grave Threat to National Security\n\n**1. Declining Squadron Strength**\n\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF) requires 45 squadrons to effectively handle a two-front war scenario and at least 39 squadrons for peacetime operations. The sanctioned strength has historically been 42 squadrons, yet it has now dwindled to 29-30 squadrons - the lowest in decades. **This translates to a shortfall of 216 fighter jets, posing a severe risk to national security.**\n\nWhile the government frequently touts its commitment to military modernization, the reality is that aircraft retirements have outpaced inductions. Legacy platforms such as the MiG-21, MiG-27, Jaguar, and Mirage-2000 are rapidly approaching obsolescence, and despite repeated warnings from IAF officials and defense experts, efforts to fast-track replacements have been inadequate.\n\n**2. MRFA Deal**\n\nThe IAF has been advocating for the acquisition of 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) under the \"Make in India\" initiative. However, the procurement process has remained mired in bureaucratic inertia, with no substantial progress.\n\nThe original Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) tender issued in 2007 **aimed to procure 126 fourth-generation fighter jets**, with domestic production as a key component. Rafale emerged as the selected platform in 2012, but the Modi government scrapped the deal, opting instead for an off-the-shelf purchase of **just 36 Rafale jets in 2016-far below operational requirements.**\n\nA new MRFA procurement process was initiated in 2018, yet as of 2025, no concrete steps have been taken toward finalizing the deal.\n\n**3. Shortcomings in ‘Make in India’ and Indigenous Development**\n\nDespite the government’s rhetoric about promoting domestic defense manufacturing, critical indigenous programs continue to face significant delays. The Tejas MK-1A and 5th GenAdvanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) projects are progressing at a sluggish pace, with AMCA’s induction projected for 2035 at the earliest - an optimistic estimate.\n\nThe LCA Tejas was intended to replace the aging MiG-21 fleet, yet despite over 40 years of development, the Indian Air Force (IAF) still has only a handful of Tejas jets in frontline service. The original order of 96 Tejas jets remains unfulfilled, with no clear timeline for completion. Meanwhile, the **IAF Chief has publicly criticized HAL at Aero India**, highlighting the delays and inefficiencies in production.\n\nAt the same time, the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) deal, which was supposed to be executed under the Strategic Partnership model with domestic manufacturing, has seen no significant progress.\n\n**4. Electoral Gimmicks Over Genuine Capability Building**\n\nThe Rafale deal, which was politicized before the 2019 elections, was presented as a major defense achievement. However, the IAF’s critical squadron strength crisis was never meaningfully addressed.\n\n**The Modi government continues to leverage military operations - such as the Balakot airstrikes- for political mileage**, while neglecting essential modernization efforts to strengthen the Air Force.\n\nDespite projecting itself as a champion of defense reforms, the government’s inaction on the MRFA deal and failure to maintain squadron strength expose a clear contradiction between political rhetoric and strategic priorities. While Pakistan is set to induct Chinese-made J-35 fifth-generation fighter jets, India's AMCA program is still at least a decade away from becoming a reality.\n\nYet, instead of addressing these critical national security concerns, public discourse remains preoccupied with language debates and electing incompetent leaders. **Is this truly the best course of action for the country?**\n\n"

        "selftext": "Newbie here but I’ve been into military aviation tech for a long time, mostly US and Russian platforms. Stuff like how the F15 evolved from the ‘70s, the Raptor’s internal bays and LO features, the AL31 vs F119, even the MiG 1.44 dead ends. Lately, I’ve been digging into India’s aviation efforts (Tejas, AMCA, Kaveri, etc.), and I’m trying to understand some of the core challenges from a technical standpoint. I'm Indian btw, I was just not interested in Indian aviation tech but recently got into in after 'Operation Sindoor'.\n\nOne thing that stands out, jet engine development seems to be a massive bottleneck. From what I gather, India’s been trying to get a fighter-grade engine off the ground since the '80s (Kaveri?), and yet it still relies on GE and Safran for propulsion. That’s a huge dependency, especially for a country trying to field a 5th gen jet like the AMCA.\n\nI’ve got a few specific questions that I’d love to get some insight on, especially from folks who track DRDO, HAL, or Indian aviation projects closely.\n\nWhat exactly held back the Kaveri engine? Was it a materials science issue (single crystal turbine blades), insufficient cooling tech, or design inefficiencies? Or was it more about lack of experience in iterative prototyping and testing (just not having enough engineering brain power)?\n\nWhy hasn’t India tried codeveloping an engine with GE or Safran more aggressively earlier? There’s talk of cooperation now, but it seems 20 years late.\n\nHow capable is the Indian supply chain when it comes to precision manufacturing for engines? Like, are there domestic companies that can reliably machine blisks or high tolerance compressor parts?\n\nIs the lack of an engine also the reason India hasn’t attempted a twin engine 4.5 gen jet before the AMCA or TEDBF? Even China built a Su27 clone first.\n\nWhat’s the realistic plan for AMCA propulsion? I’ve read about prototypes flying with GEF414s and eventual French collaboration. But is there actually a roadmap to a 110–120 kN class indigenous engine, or is that political wishful thinking?\n\nHow does India’s engine R&D ecosystem compare to what the US or USSR had in the ‘70s? I’m thinking of places like NPO Saturn or Pratt & Whitney, which had massive government backing and industrial depth. Does GTRE have anything comparable?\n\nIs India maybe trying to leapfrog too much like skipping twin engine 4.5 gen platforms and going straight for stealth and 6th gen stuff? Would a more iterative path (indigenous MiG 29 equivalent first) have made more sense?\n\nJust trying to get a deeper understanding of what’s holding things back beyond the usual “bureaucracy” or “lack of investment” answers. It seems like there’s a need for deep talent in India or it probably already has but we've failed to utilise it from a managerial perspective. Something isn’t clicking when it comes to turbine tech.\n\nI hope the post isn't too long. Thanks.\n"
