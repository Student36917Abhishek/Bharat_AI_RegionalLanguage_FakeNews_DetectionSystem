        "selftext": "**TL:DR - My friends and I were playing around with Linux and accidentally submitted a 9700X3D score, which got written up in the news. I'd like to set the record straight: The 9700X3D isn't real, and we should all learn from this. Remember, all benchmarks can be faked!**\n\nA weeks ago, my friends and I were talking about the inner workings of Zen 5. We were talking about how the CPUID instruction works, and how AMD MSRs are technically editable if you ask the processor nicely. One of us realized you could mess with Linux's `/proc/cpuinfo` to change your CPU to whatever you want, and we were wondering whether benchmark software would detect this... so, to test, one of us took a heavily PBO'd 9700X and changed `/proc/cpuinfo` to be a \"9700X3D\" and ran a Passmark run to see if the software would be fooled...\n\n[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+9700X3D+8-Core&id=6993](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+9700X3D+8-Core&id=6993) (taken down as of Nov. 8)\n\n...It turns out that Passmark not only didn't notice that `/proc/cpuinfo` didn't match the CPUID, it **actually submitted the result to the real live Passmark database**... which is how we got here. Fast forward to today, and I google \"9700X3D\" out of curiosity. [TPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/342644/amd-ryzen-7-9700x3d-appears-in-leaked-passmark-benchmark), Videocardz, [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-prepping-new-x3d-chip-with-higher-clock-speeds-ryzen-7-9700x3d-spotted-in-benchmarks-that-rival-ryzen-7-9800x3d-new-strix-halo-chip-also-unearthed), [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Ryzen-7-9700X3D-New-Zen-5-CPU-shows-up-on-PassMark.1155991.0.html), [igorsLAB](https://www.igorslab.de/en/ryzen-7-9700x3d-new-amd-processor-shows-up-in-benchmark-with-uncertainties/), KitGuru, [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/news/110140-amd-prepares-ryzen-7-9700x3d-budget-friendly-3d.html), OC3D, and countless others... **all wrote articles about a single unverified Passmark test.** Shoutout to Videocardz, KitGuru, TPU, and NotebookCheck who (as of the time of editing) corrected their articles. There might be more that I haven't found yet.\n\nYou can preorder one [here](https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-ryzen-7-9700x3d-processor-pre-order-8-cores-16-threads-3d-v-cache-high-performance-gaming-cpu), apparently. Crazy.\n\nSo, uh, here we are now. I'm writing this post partly to set the record straight that this CPU is not real (as far as I know?), but I'm also writing to tech fans and journalists everywhere, to say: **DO NOT TRUST ONE-OFF ONLINE BENCHMARKS!**\n\nIn this case, we used `/proc/cpuinfo` to fool the test suite. `/proc/cpuinfo` is very easy to spoof because it's just an inode (see code below), but it's still possible to spoof any other part of the system too, even the hardware-level AMD64 CPUID instruction (either using a VM or by editing the MSRs using AMD's debugging system) which means that Windows isn't safe either. To be clear, this isn't a problem specific to Passmark, it's just a fact of computing, that **there is no real way to 100% guarantee a benchmark is accurate.**\n\nYou might think \"Benchmark companies need to be more careful about accepting results!\", which is true, but even if Passmark *had* checked if cpuinfo matched CPUID, a bad actor might still get away with it by simply changing both.\n\n*Really, the only solid takeaway here is that we all need to do better at double-checking any rumours.* Many redditors correctly pointed out that the clock speeds were much higher than even a 9800X3D, which is correct. If we had actually been trying to fake a listing, we might have noticed that, but we are doofuses messing with Linux and we were just curious if it would even work.\n\nSome media outlets even started making things up in an attempt to seem informed. TechPowerUp wrote: *\"Current rumors suggest it will feature a 120 W TDP, targeting the same $400-$450 range as its predecessor.\"* which isn't specified anywhere at all. VideoCardz also suggests a 120W TDP, but they also correctly recognise that the clocks are way too high. To be clear, I have no idea how the 120W rumour started, but it scares me that it only took less than a week before people started making facts up.\n\n**Obligatory disclaimer: Please don't fake CPU benchmarks!** I feel badly for all of the people who may have held off on a 9800X3D purchase because of this Passmark that we *thought* wouldn't work. That's a big part of why I wrote this post.\n\nThe way we did this particular edit was with the following line of Linux terminal nonsense; `sed -E 's/^(model name[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*).*/\\1desired shenanigans/' /proc/cpuinfo | sudo tee /root/fakecpuinfo >/dev/null && sudo mount --bind /root/fakecpuinfo /proc/cpuinfo`\n\nThis isn't the only way, though. [Chips And Cheese](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/why-you-cant-trust-cpuid) did an excellent article on editing the CPUID bits themselves. You can also change these bits using a VM, of course.\n\n# Thank you all for reading, may your GHz be high and your temperatures low. Remember, never trust a benchmark.\n\n\\- 0xF7FF\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the funny words! I've fixed some typos. I'm in the comments if you have any questions, I guess. Massive shoutout to Arae down in the comments, the owner of the world's only Ryzen 7 9700X3D and the person who started this hilarious mess. **Here are some background splash images that were made for the articles discussing this nonexistent CPU:**\n\n[AM5 is such a beautiful socket, and CowCotLand did a great job displaying it.](https://preview.redd.it/yjb7z6lsd00g1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=237039f00bd32b7737b1e7953494b3792ac87009)\n\n[Now THAT's the money shot. Club386 did a beautiful one here.](https://preview.redd.it/bqp86vxwd00g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df0b1791980aad3f3d4875a98f4418c14c93112f)\n\n[I absolutely love the background on this one, really nice design from profesionalreview](https://preview.redd.it/swed8i22e00g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acbde77ca513e7269867e1664fb9890991b71a69)\n\n[IndieKings might have just released my new wallpaper!](https://preview.redd.it/k68bpym7e00g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cefaf88b430df1d507634bce25789c06e179a329)\n\nI have no idea if AMD is \\*actually\\* working on a 9700X3D. I don't think so, (I mean, they haven't made a 7700X3D), and it definitely won't be 5.8GHz, but hey, they might. All of this shenanigans has taken place starting Nov. 3rd, so anything after this dies down might be real.\n\nEdit 2 (Nov 8th): Thank you to Passmark for the [wonderful response](https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1987286968313745488)! Remember, folks, Passmark is doing everything they can, it's just not feasable to manually fact-check every single benchmark, and it's not possible to guarantee data collection isn't spoofed in a VM or by editing MSRs. The only \"mistake\" here was when someone *else* crawled Passmark's database and thought \"Hey, this'll make a good story!\" with no verification."

        "selftext": "# Intro\n\n**Hypothesis**: A large artificial object is en route to Earth and has been detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST); its origin and intent are unknown. The U.S. government has possibly known about it for decades and has actively prevented public and scientific disclosure.\n\n**Operational Assumption**: If such an object exists and the government has known about it, then supporting data open source, leaked, indirect, etc, should be detectable or inferable.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# JWST (2024)\n\nAll of this began in Fall 2024, when rumors began circulating online regarding the JWST capturing a course-correcting artificial celestial object en route to Earth. In the end, nothing came about it officially, however its been documented that Congress was briefed on something the JWST saw. Much speculation on what it was from many people, including Jeremy Corbell who stated that the government is going to claim that an object half the speed of light is enroute to earth and is going to be used as a premise for a fake alien invasion. Even with all this speculation, we can still formulate a matrix of constraints regarding this objects properties, and we do that in relation to the JWST's Specs. First of all, no way in hell that Telescope can capture an object moving at 50% the speed of light, not even at 10%. The JWST is an infrared telescope that has 5sec or more exposure time for each capture (I think upwards of over 100sec). The best it can do is capture an object moving at 1% the speed of light (3,000km/s), and that's wishful thinking, cause then it would have to be something that's being precisely pre-tracked, where JWST is capturing the area of space is going to be in.\n\nSo if JWST saw the object in question, we range of speed(s) its heading to us, the next portion is how big is it, which is even trickier. JWST can detect objects as small as \\~100 meters **within the inner solar system** if they’re warm or metal-rich. In the **outer solar system (50–100 AU)**, detectability starts around \\~0.5 km. Anything smaller or colder becomes invisible beyond that unless it emits **active infrared energy**. Between Earth and Proxima Centauri, the object would need to be **Moon-sized or radiating heat** to be observable.\n\nWe also have to take into account that JWST is positioned at the **Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange Point**, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, facing away from the Sun. This location gives it an unobstructed infrared view of deep space while maintaining thermal stability through permanent solar shielding. However, JWST has a **solar exclusion zone**—it cannot point within roughly ±25° of the Sun—meaning any object coming directly from behind or through the Sun–Earth vector would be invisible until it moves into JWST’s field of regard.\n\nThat makes the rumored **September 2024 sighting highly plausible** if the object had just emerged from behind the Sun or shifted into a detectable trajectory due to its **course correction behavior**, as reported. This would imply the object entered JWST’s observable window just long enough for infrared sensors to detect it. If it's set to **arrive around January or February 2027**, then the orbital geometry would match a slow inbound trajectory from the outer solar system, possibly from a high-inclination angle or using the Sun as visual cover. The timeline supports a **non-relativistic velocity**, likely in the 10–50 km/s range, which aligns with what JWST is technically capable of tracking if the object radiates enough thermal energy. This also reinforces the idea that the object is **not traveling in a straight line**, but rather a **curved, gravitationally-informed path**—potentially executing energy-efficient, subtle course corrections that are consistent with artificial guidance.\n\n|Category|Speed|Interpretation|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Lower Bound|\\~5 km/s|interplanetary cruise speeds, e.g., pro**b**bes or asteroids|\n|Upper Bound (Infrared-trackable)|\\~30–50 km/s|still resolvable, non-relativistic|\n|JWST Detection Cutoff|\\~100 km/s|likely too fast for stable resolution, unless pre-tracked and targeted|\n|Relativistic Threshold|≥ 30,000 km/s (0.1c)|**undetectable** by JWST due to field-of-view traversal time and non-IR emissions|\n\n \\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Home Telescope Companies (2024)\n\nMy first instinct in this, was that the government wants to keep this information a secret until people see it in the sky and it’s too late to react meaningfully. The only practical way to see something faint and inbound before it becomes visible to the naked eye is through a high-end home telescope. So I presumed there had to be deliberate disruption in the civilian supply chain for observational equipment.\n\nThen in mid-2024, three of the most prominent home telescope manufacturers — Orion and Meade, either ceased operations, declared bankruptcy, or were acquired by opaque holding companies, with sudden restructuring or mass discontinuations of key product lines. This doesn’t outright block people from observing the sky, but it raises the barrier of entry high enough to create a functional blind spot in amateur astronomy, these three companies were the top 3 in home telescopes in North America and Europe. Brands such as Celestron and Sky-Watcher still remain active and functional.\n\n|Company|Status|Notes/Action|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Meade Instruments**|Ceased operations (July 2024)|California offices closed; assets being auctioned|\n|**Orion Telescopes**|Ceased operations (July 2024)|HQ/stores in Watsonville closed; no staff or support|\n|**Celestron**|**Still operating**|Launching new models (e.g., “Origin”) and offering promotions|\n|**Sky-Watcher**|Operating (import/distribution)|Active in North America/Europe|\n|**Obsession Telescopes**|Operating (specialty Dobsonians)|Continuously manufacturing high-end scopes|\n\n \\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Dead Astronomers\n\nMy **second instinct**, after looking into the sudden disruption of home telescope supply chains, was to check if any professional astronomers had died under unusual circumstances — especially those who might have had the **right vantage point** to detect a faint inbound object before the public ever saw it. What I found was a pattern of deaths, disappearances, and abrupt terminations among astronomers with **precise alignment to a common sky vector** — specifically those operating in the **Southern Hemisphere**. This corridor, especially at high inclinations (45°–60°), would be the **ideal approach vector** for an artificial object trying to remain concealed until the final phase of entry.\n\nSeveral astronomers tied to this corridor — including Koichiro Morita (ALMA, Chile), Tom Marsh (Las Campanas, Chile), and Eugene Shoemaker (Australia) — either **died unexpectedly**, **disappeared temporarily**, or were **involved in high-risk or isolated fieldwork**. Each of them had unique access to **infrared, submillimeter, or impact-mapping tools**, and each operated from a location **geometrically aligned to detect an object inbound from the solar south**. When cross-referenced with northern observers like Marc Aaronson (Arizona) and Walter Steiger (Hawaii), a consistent picture forms: these astronomers’ observatories **collectively covered an inclined arc** \n\n\n\n|**Astronomer**|**Location**|**Observatory / Method**|**Sky Vector Access**|**Circumstances**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Koichiro Morita**|Chile|ALMA (Sub-mm Array)|Perfect southern sky, cold object tracking|Stabbed outside his apartment 2012|\n|**Tom Marsh**|Chile|Las Campanas|Deep time-domain, transient monitoring|Went missing in 2022; found 10 days later dead in a ditch|\n|**Marc Aaronson**|Arizona, USA|Kitt Peak (Infrared)|Same sky slice as Voyager outbound|Got crushed by the telescope hatch in 1987|\n|**Walter R.

To me he's using hypothetical framing to tell us what's happening, and get us to research it. More so in his early podcasts and interviews before the release of his book. To me the interview with Curt Jaimungal on Theory of Everything was very telling, especially when asked if he would still have kids knowing everything he knows. That question caught him off guard, and he started choking.\n\nHowever, I don't think his beginning interviews went under the radar and was probably told something about it. I also believe his recent and previous debacle regarding the posting of UFO Photos that are fake as a way to strategically ruin his reputation or so, to take people's attention off of what he has said. Not only this, I am genuinely disturbed that he wasted no time in moving out to Wyoming and started building a bunker. When asked about it, all he said was he has a right to do so.\n\nWhat I want to focus on was a phrase he made on a podcast interview using hypothetical framing. Where he mentioned \"we've had 50 years or so to prepare... \" (I am paraphrasing). That interview happened in 2022, so exactly what happened 50 years?\n\nWas it the U.S. dropping the gold standard in 1971 under President Nixon, because they wanted to hoard all the gold incase the Anunnaki came back to ask for more gold, or was it something else?\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Launch of Pioneers & Voyagers (1972)\n\n Between 1972 and 1977, NASA launched the first-ever **deep space probbes** from the United States: **Pioneer 10**, **Pioneer 11**, **Voyager 1**, and **Voyager 2**. These were humanity’s earliest attempts at interstellar contact and exploration. Both Pioneers carried engraved plaques designed by Carl Sagan, intended as messages for any intelligent life that might encounter them. Voyager 1 and 2 followed with the more elaborate **Golden Records**. The Pioneers followed different solar escape vectors — Pioneer 10 exited **north** of the ecliptic, Pioneer 11 to the **south** — and both experienced the unexplained **Pioneer Anomaly**, a small but persistent sunward deceleration. The Voyagers did **not** exhibit this anomaly, possibly due to differences in trajectory, design, or interaction geometry.\n\nSince 1977, **no U.S. deep space probbe** launched through 2025 has carried any kind of **plaque or interstellar message**. Though over a dozen missions have been launched into heliocentric or escape trajectories (e.g., New Horizons, Parker Solar Probbe, Lucy), none have included symbolic or communicative artifacts like the Pioneers or Voyagers\n\n|Probbe|**Launch Date**|**Primary Mission**|**Escape Trajectory / Direction**|**Ecliptic Hemisphere**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Pioneer 10**|March 2, 1972|Jupiter flyby; first deep space mission|Toward Taurus constellation|**North**|\n|**Pioneer 11**|April 5, 1973|Jupiter & Saturn flybys|Toward Scutum constellation|**South**|\n|**Voyager 2**|August 20, 1977|Outer planet grand tour (Jupiter–Neptune)|Toward Sagittarius; exited below the ecliptic|**South**|\n|**Voyager 1**|September 5, 1977|Jupiter & Saturn; fastest and farthest probbe|Toward Ophiuchus; exited above the ecliptic|**North**|\n\n|**Category**|**# of Missions**|**Definition**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Outer Solar System / Interstellar**|8|**beyond the asteroid beltJupiter, Saturn, Pluto**Probbes that travel  , targeting  , or escaping the solar system entirely.

Includes sample-return missions and kinetic impactors.|\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Ecliptic Plane\n\nThe **ecliptic plane** is the flat, disk-like surface defined by Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Nearly all planets orbit within a few degrees of this plane, making it the reference layer for most solar system dynamics. You can think of it like the **surface of an ocean**, with planets and most probbes “floating” on it — some with slight tilt or buoyancy, but still generally constrained to the surface.\n\nIn this analogy, the **Pioneer and Voyager prob**b**es** used gravity assists to either **go airborne** above the plane or **submerge** below it — altering their inclination enough to **escape the solar system’s orbital plane entirely**.\n\n* **Pioneer 10** and **Voyager 1** used assists from **Jupiter (Pioneer 10)** and **Saturn (Voyager 1)** to launch **above the ecliptic**, like aircraft breaking the surface.\n* **Pioneer 11** and **Voyager 2**, by contrast, were steered into **southward trajectories**, diving **below the ecliptic**, like submersibles entering deeper orbital layers.\n\nWhile Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and Voyager 1 achieved their ecliptic departure angles through gravity assists in the Jupiter–Saturn region, **Voyager 2** required a multi-step assist chain — with **Neptune's flyby in 1989** providing the final slingshot that redirected it southward and out of the solar system.\n\n \\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pioneer Anomaly & Missing Data Tapes\n\nThe **Pioneer Anomaly** is a small, consistent sunward deceleration of **(8.74 ± 1.33) × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s²** observed in the trajectories of **Pioneer 10** and **Pioneer 11**, first identified through Doppler tracking data from the 1980s when the spacecraft were beyond **20 AU** from the Sun, with detailed analysis confirming the effect by **1994** (*Turyshev & Toth, 2010*). A 2012 NASA study proposed that this anomaly likely stems from **anisotropic thermal recoil**, caused by uneven heat emission from the spacecraft’s radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), though this explanation remains under ongoing investigation and does not fully account for why **Voyager 1 and 2**, which also use RTGs, showed no similar effect.\n\nThe data supporting this anomaly comes from Mission Data Records (MDRs), totaling approximately **40 GB**, transcribed from magnetic tapes to magneto-optical media. However, significant gaps exist: for **Pioneer 10**, key periods like the **Jupiter encounter (DOY 332–341, 1973)** and other days (e.g., 1972: 133–149, 1974: 034–054) are missing, partly due to **magnetic tape damage** or unreadable media, as noted in transcription log sheets (Section 3.5.1, Table 3.5). For **Pioneer 11**, missing data spans 1973 (056–094) to 1990 (081–096), with causes including tape degradation. These gaps limit the anomaly’s full characterization.\n\nTheoretically, the anomaly could suggest an external gravitational influence from an unknown object in deep space. If so, its mass could be estimated from the deceleration, with size (diameter) inversely proportional to material density—lower density requiring a larger volume to exert the same effect. Such an object, possibly spherical or toroidal, might be engineered or naturally stealthy, evading detection by infrared or optical systems due to its trajectory or emission properties. While speculative, this hypothesis posits the Pioneers as potential indirect probbes of an artificial or unknown celestial body, though current evidence leans toward thermal effects as the primary cause.\n\nI believe this object to be somewhere in the vicinity of 100km in diameter and possibly a toroid shape.\n\n|**Composition Type**|**Mean Density (g/cm³)**|**Toroid Outer Diameter (km)**|**Estimated Mass (kg)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Osmium (metallic)**|22.6|\\~34.0|\\~1.00 × 10¹⁹|\n|**Earth (silicate–iron)**|5.51|\\~54.3|\\~1.00 × 10¹⁹|\n|**Venus**|5.24|\\~55.2|\\~1.00 × 10¹⁹|\n|**Mercury**|5.43|\\~54.6|\\~1.00 × 10¹⁹|\n|**Lithium (ultralight metal)**|0.53|\\~119.0|\\~1.00 × 10¹⁹|\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vop1sef7m7f1.png?width=1731&format=png&auto=webp&s=306c3e00427efc9a6df283bdba52928f5e042a2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/du1txrpg7m7f1.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7acfb687f6b73087d4a79346664350d6bc1167b\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Mariner Probbe Anomaly (1974)\n\nIn March 1974, Mariner 10 detected intense, transient extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions (\\~1300–1600 Å) near Mercury, two days before its first flyby, with signals reappearing three days later, seemingly “detaching” from the planet. Uncorrelated with solar flares or background activity, the emissions defied NASA’s explanations of instrument artifacts or the star 31 Crateris, remaining unresolved (Astrophys. J., 1974, Vol. 192, L117). A hypothetical large artificial object—a completely black, uniform-density toroid (\\~34–119 km diameter, mass \\~10¹⁹ kg)—could explain the anomaly. Orbiting near Mercury (\\~0.39 AU), its surface, despite absorbing visible light, may scatter solar EUV due to micro-structures or material properties (e.g., osmium-like composition), or perturb Mercury’s exosphere, causing excited atoms to reflect UV. The object’s course correction accounts for the “detaching” signal, as it moves relative to Mercury. This scenario suggests an unknown energetic source in the inner solar system, potentially studied covertly by Mariner 10, though mainstream science favors astrophysical or instrumental causes.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Forgotten-Languages & DP-2147\n\nThe website \"Forgotten Languages\" (forgottenlanguages.org), active since 2008, is an enigmatic online platform that explores a wide range of topics including linguistics, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and extraterrestrial theories. Managed under the pseudonym Ayndryl with contributions from multiple authors, it features daily articles written in over 50 constructed \"anti-languages\"—artificial languages designed for in-group communication and to resist decoding by outsiders. These texts often include English snippets touching on quantum mechanics, UFOs, and esoteric knowledge, suggesting a blend of scientific and speculative content, possibly generated using software like NodeSpaces 2.0, which simulates language evolution from colliding cultures over time.\n\nA recurring subject on the site is \"DP-2147,\" described as a mysterious object or probbe with unusual characteristics, such as infrared emissions hinting at technological waste heat and a signal at 1.42341 GHz, interpreted as a deliberate communication attempt. Posts speculate it may be an artificial entity, possibly orbiting near the solar system, with connections to objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113, and linked to concepts like temporary captured orbiters or Denebian probbes. The site frames DP-2147 as a potential technosignature, sparking debates about secrecy, global security, and its implications, though its true nature remains unverified and steeped in the site’s cryptic narrative.\n\n[FL Response To The Previous Post - 2 Days Later](https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/2025/04/the-unseen-architect-advanced.html)\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Dorpat Observatory (1827)\n\nIn 1827, the Dorpat Astronomical Observatory, located in what is now Tartu, Estonia, stood as a pioneering hub of astronomical research under the direction of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve. Established in 1810 and equipped with a state-of-the-art Fraunhofer refractor by 1824, its purpose was to advance stellar astronomy, particularly through meticulous observations of double and multiple star systems. That year, Struve began compiling the *Catalogus novus stellarum duplicium*, assigning objects the “Dp. XXXX” nomenclature—where “Dp” denoted “Dorpat” and “XXXX” represented a unique four-digit identifier (e.g., Dp. 0001 to Dp. 3000)—to catalog over 3000 double stars with unprecedented accuracy. This system facilitated systematic tracking and analysis of stellar positions and motions.\n\nGlobally, observatories in 1827, including Dorpat, actively exchanged and cross-correlated their published catalogs to refine astronomical data. Institutions like the Berlin Observatory, Göttingen, and the Royal Observatory at Greenwich shared their findings, allowing astronomers to verify star positions, resolve discrepancies, and enhance the precision of celestial maps. Dorpat’s “Dp. XXXX” entries were compared against other catalogs—such as those using Bessel’s or Argelander’s notations—enabling a collaborative effort to build a more cohesive understanding of the night sky, a practice that laid the foundation for modern astronomical databases.\n\nWith this said, I believe that \"Dp. 2147\" as found in the astronomical journal directly correlates with \"DP-2147\" as described by FL, I've marked the entries of Dp. 2147 as show in the astronomical journal. As you can see the object did a full 300 degree shift in its right ascension between 1827 and 1828-1829, a clear and gross violation of Keppler mechanics. It also seems to indicate it has a black surface or low-albedo due to the luminosity recorded on it. Due to the consistency of values across each of the 5 entries, it's a low probability that this is a typing or labeling error (but not impossible). Research and investigation will be have to be done on other astronomical journals of the time, to see if they cataloged anything similar under a different label.\n\n|Year|Month|Date|Time|Correction|Designation|Indeces|Unnamed: 7|Libella -|Unnamed: 9|Med.

On March 26, 1859, French physician and amateur astronomer Edmond Modeste Lescarbault reported observing a small, round black dot transiting the Sun, which he interpreted as Vulcan. Using a 3.75-inch refractor, he estimated its diameter as about 1/17th of Mercury’s (\\~290 km) and calculated an orbit at approximately 0.1427 AU with a 19.7-day period. Urbain Le Verrier, a leading astronomer, endorsed the sighting, suggesting it could account for Mercury's 43 arcseconds/century anomaly, though subsequent observations failed to confirm Vulcan, leaving it an unverified historical curiosity.\n\n**Explanation of the Carrington Event of September 1859 and Its 17-Hour Arrival**\n\nThe Carrington Event, occurring on September 1–2, 1859, was a massive solar storm observed by British astronomer Richard Carrington. He witnessed a solar flare, followed by a coronal mass ejection (CME) that reached Earth in an unusually swift 17.6 hours—far faster than the typical 2–4 days for solar wind effects. This anomaly, detected via telegraph disruptions and auroras visible as far south as the Caribbean, suggested an extraordinarily high-speed CME (\\~2500 km/s). To this day the Carrington Event remains a true anomaly, a CME that reached earth in 17hrs and although there are many hypothesis and models, they're all speculative in explaining how that occurred.\n\nI am more inclined to believe that the object has a toroid shape and is not a perfect sphere, but it is 100% artificial and not a hollowed out asteroid. If it is truly behind the Carrington Event, which I think was a harmonic handshake with the earth's core and signal to start the countdown for destabilizing it. Then a toroid shape object is a better model for explain how it was able to channel and focus it directly to earth, while still aligning with sightings of \"perfectly round objects\" seen orbiting across the surface of the sun.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Palomar, CA & Edwin Hubble (1953)\n\nThe **200-inch Hale Telescope** at **Palomar Observatory** was the culmination of a vision by astronomer **George Ellery Hale**, who sought to build the most powerful optical telescope of his era. Funded by the **Rockefeller Foundation** and managed by **Caltech**, construction began in the 1930s on **Palomar Mountain, California**, a location selected for its high altitude, stable atmosphere, and dark skies. After delays due to World War II, the telescope achieved **first light and began scientific operations on January 26, 1949**. At the time, it was the **largest and most advanced optical telescope in the world**, featuring a 200-inch Pyrex mirror, precision motorized tracking, and cutting-edge spectrographic capabilities.\n\n**Edwin Hubble**, who had revolutionized cosmology through his work at Mount Wilson, played a critical role in the scientific vision of the Hale Telescope. He was one of its earliest users and continued observations there until his death on **September 28, 1953**. His final years at Palomar extended his research into galaxy classification and redshift analysis.\n\nNotably, **1953** also marked the introduction of **early infrared observational techniques** at Palomar. These used **cooled lead sulfide detectors** to capture thermal emissions in the **near-infrared spectrum (\\~1–3 microns)**—a pioneering development at a time when infrared astronomy was still experimental. These tools enabled astronomers to observe objects and structures obscured in visible light, laying groundwork for future space-based infrared astronomy.\n\nI believe that the object in question was discovered in 1953 via this infrared ground telescope that had the means to see it, upon discovering it I am assuming researches went through all the historical astronomical journals and scoured for any anomolous objects, till they came across \"Dp. 2147\" which matched it.\n\n \\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# Neutrinos & The Earth's Core (2006 & 2014)\n\nThe **ANITA (Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna)** experiment, a NASA-funded high-altitude balloon mission, detected **anomalous high-energy neutrino events** over Antarctica during flights in **December 2006** and again in **December 2014**. ANITA is designed to capture **radio pulses emitted by ultra-high-energy neutrinos** (energies ≥ 10¹⁸ eV) as they interact with the Antarctic ice via the Askaryan effect. Typically, neutrinos travel through Earth nearly unimpeded, but ANITA recorded **upward-propagating radio pulses** that appeared to originate from deep within the ice and at steep angles—**as if the particles had passed through the planet**, which defies standard model predictions for such high energies.\n\nThese events could not be easily explained as background noise, cosmic ray reflections, or known atmospheric interactions. The characteristics of the 2006 and 2014 signals suggested the presence of a **tau-lepton decay signature**, implying that a tau neutrino entered Earth on one side and exited on the other—a scenario highly improbable under current neutrino cross-section models. As of 2025, the origin of these anomalous events remains **unresolved**, with hypotheses ranging from **beyond-standard-model physics (e.g., sterile neutrinos)** to **instrumental or environmental anomalies**, though no definitive conclusion has been reached.\n\n**Citations:**\n\n* [Gorham et al. (2016), *Characteristics of Four Upward-pointing Cosmic-ray-like Events Observed with ANITA*, Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 071101.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05218)\n* [Gorham et al. (2018), *Observation of an Unusual Upward-going Cosmic-Ray-like Event*, arXiv:1803.05088.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05088)\n\n \n\nI believe that this is the object's modality of causing reoccurring cataclysms on earth, by shooting high-energy neutrino's into the earth's core via the North Pole, hence heating it up and destabilizing it. This may explain the anomalous we've seen with the Earth's core in recent years and the geophysical anomalies we've seen because of it. Such as the frequency of deep earth earthquakes growing since the 1990s and other anomalous geophysical events. All which are now being pointed to the Sun as the culprit through its Micronova Cycle (see Suspici0ous Observers for that).\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n \n\n# HAARP & SURA\n\n**HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program)** is a research facility located in Gakona, Alaska, developed in the early 1990s through a collaboration between the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, DARPA, and the University of Alaska. Its primary instrument is the **IONOSPHERIC RESEARCH INSTRUMENT (IRI)**—a powerful array of 180 high-frequency antennas designed to transmit RF energy into the ionosphere for experimental purposes. HAARP’s stated objectives include studying ionospheric physics, radio wave propagation, and space weather. Though originally under military oversight, it transitioned to full civilian operation by the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015.\n\n**SURA**, located near Vasilsursk in Russia, is HAARP’s lesser-known counterpart. Operational since **1981**, it uses a 300 kW HF transmitter system to investigate ionospheric processes similar to HAARP. What distinguishes SURA is its **continuous operation**, even throughout the **collapse of the Soviet Union** and the post-Soviet economic transition—a rare feat for high-energy research infrastructure. Despite limited Western visibility, it has remained **operational without major interruptions** for over four decades, supporting both academic and potentially classified applications related to geophysical and radio-frequency studies.\n\nBoth HAARP and SURA have attracted public speculation for their capacity to manipulate the ionosphere, but their confirmed uses remain centered on controlled experiments in **upper-atmospheric and radio science**.\n\nI believe that HAARP and SURA are somehow involved with this and their purposes is to induce ionosphere heating and indirectly cause polar ice caps to melt more each year, causing a a feedback loop. Which in turn causes the polar vortex to go more south every year, hence the 2021 Texas Winter Disaster. The purpose of this would be to meld all the ice and take strain/pressure off the lithosphere on the Earth's mantle from all the weight of the Ice (it's several Kms thick). Doing so, would have planet earth be operating on borrowed time, by delaying the inevitable and ultimately making the on-coming cataclysm, more \"survivable\" but still really bad. Of course my theory may have some holes in it, in regards to the power requirements needed to achieve this coupled with the published power consumption of both installations. I implore you all to do more research on this, either to refute me or validate it. How much borrowed time has HAARP and SURA given us? I don't know, maybe 20 years at max?\n\n \\---\n\n# What's The Object's Name & Origin? Who's Behind It? Purpose?\n\nI don't know, I mean it could it be the gold digging nnakis, the dickless greys or Guilty-Spark running amok after the Forerunners abandoned him, your guess is as good as mine. All indications seem to signal, it maybe part of a larger architecture in our solar system. I don't think it's alone, but I also think its the node or the the watcher. I also think this object is the operator of the Sphere Network (e.g. Buga sphere) which acts as a sentinel here on earth. Earth may well be a nature preserve planet, and NHIs such as the greys are interlopers or trespassers on the planet. I do think this object has been responsible for the cyclical cataclysms found on earth in the last 100K-200K years, and their intervals may not be entirely discrete. In 1827 was right about the time humanity entered 1-billion people, maybe there is a reason the author's of the Georgia Guidestone's mentioned a population of 500-million or less. However I doubt the threshold paramters for it are set to only human population sizes. I am sure the spheres also measure industrial outputs, etc. and have a multi-facet decision model on what constitutes a reset-countdown.\n\nI also don't believe that Atlantis, Ancient Egypt, Lemuria, etc. had technology more advanced than what we currently have, now in the 21st century. I think Atlantis reached 19th century technology levels before the cataclysm, and maybe the preceding ones reached 1 century lower than the succeeding civilizations. Maybe this is a way for us to spur technological growth and induce some kind of natural change in humanity. I honestly don't know what's the purpose or end-game here, however the data points to all of this having an architectural design.\n\nI also believe that this object is behind the Wow Signal! but that's just pure speculation on my part.\n\n \\---\n\n\n\n\n\n# What's It's Actual Size (and shape) and orbit?\n\nI made some mistakes with the previous size I stated (I think I kept an extra zero), the size is inversely proportional to the material composition of it using the data from the pioneer anomaly. I am going to arbitrarily state the size as 100km in diameter with 10km thickness and an inner radius of 40km since I am theorizing it's not a perfect sphere but a toroid, this model can explain the channeling and focusing of the Carrington Event, the low albedo it has (based on angle its observed at) and why its existence is kept secret. Besides the fact this thing clearly violates keppler mechanics which is one thing, its shape would be a dead give away that its artificial without a doubt. Think of the Face on Mars, how NASA has plausibly stated how its a natural formation, I doubt that same statement would work on this object. It's orbit is artificial, I don't have any real historical information of its orbit except its sightings passing over the sun's surface and the 5 entires in the astronomical journal. I realize that the 6.55-Yearly Cycle I gave was too perfect and was partially me forcing a model on its orbit. However it is weird how it aligned perfectly with the 1953 Discovery, Astronomer Deaths, 2027 Arrival Window and the cycles of El Nino and La Nina being 6.55 Years. So I don't know its true past orbits or future perbutations, maybe someone more astronomically-inclined can discover something.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n# When Is It Arriving? What Happens When It Gets Here?\n\nIt's going to get here, when it feels like it (technically its always been passing by us keeping a close eye), and based off Lue Elizondo's comments on the podcast with Jai from Theory of Everything, I don't believe that the researchers themselves even truly know. Watch the whole podcast and you'll notice what I mean when he's asked about 2027. However it seems that they're operating with data outside my purview and that of Open-Source Data, meaning that they've probably calculated a probability of some kind of inflection point occurring in 2027. Maybe things were actually supposed to end in and around 2012, but HAARP and SURA have genuinely bought us time, explains the statement we've recently heard from Colthart regarding borrowed time.\n\nWhen it arrives or what happens when it gets here, is something that I am by no means qualified to inform anyone about. But I will say this, based on the fact that two prominent name brand home telescope companies went out of business and assuming it was intentionally orchestrated because of this object. Then I can safely state that your government (or should I say our government) is not going to tell us shit till, it hits the fan.\n\nSome of you may scold me, stating that you're better off not knowing about it till it happens. And I would agree if we're all stepping into the unknown together, but sadly we're not. Some of us are going into really nice bunkers. Although I can't hate them for having the opportunity and taking it at the same time, it is inhuman to keep the rest of us in the dark about it. And again, I don't know if the arrival triggers a cataclysm. Or maybe the object will come and say we \"passed\" imparting us a gift before going off into another dimension, I simply don't know.\n\nI do think the existence and the clandestine monitoring of this object over the decades is what has caused the conversations regarding Planet X/Nibiru ever so often and its impending arrival.\n\n\\---\n\n# Final After Thoughts\n\nI better not get any schizo DMs this time. Do your own due diligence."

She was born from a one night stand with a now former friend(37M). We never got together and he refused to be involved in my pregnancy or my daughter's first 4 years of life. I was stressed out emotionally because its a big change, but I never asked for child support or force him to be involved. I have enough income to send my daughter to private school. I'm perfectly fine on my own.\n\nThe issue started when he reappeared from wherever he went and decided he wanted visitation. He's not in my daughter's birth certificate. Father is listed as 'unknown'. He wanted to have that amended. I said no, and that if he wants, best he'll get is to meet her in outings with myself or my daughter's godparents. He agreed, but he's been constantly pressuring getting parental rights. Court already gave him a big fat no, unless he pays 4 years of child support which with his income goes somewhere around 230k USD. He hasn't paid a cent.\n\nMy daughter doesn't even call him dad. Or recognize him as dad. She calls him 'mister'. I keep it very clean. I never bad talked him, never made up stories. When she asked about her father I used to say it was just the two of us. Even during court the assigned CPS agent testified that my daughter had no affection or clear relationship with her biological father.\n\nNow the main issue happen in a PTA meeting. He would say things like 'my family thinks' or 'what is best for my family'. I didn't agree with him and I voiced by saying 'my daughter' has different needs and those are priority. He was clearly angry.\n\nAfter the meeting there was a moment for teachers and parents to mingle and just talk how the kids are doing. One of the teachers approach me to apologize, saying she didn't know 'my husband and I' didn't like a project she was doing with the kids. I told her I had no husband and my daughter loved the project and wants to be part of it. The teacher then told me that my former friend was going around talking like he's my husband and he 'represents the family'.\n\nI saw red. I walked to him and very loudly told him we needed to talk in private. In the parking lot I told him we were not a family and that he either will respect I am the only one that can make decisions on my daughter's education or he won't be involved. He went on about being her biological father, then I reminded him he had not paid a cent for the pregnancy, my daughter's needs, or even the private school my daughter is in.\n\nHe hasn't tried to see my daughter since, which she doesn't mind at all. I asked her. I do feel a bit bad about what I said. AITA?\n\nI wanted to add this because the PMs are driving me insane: He has the money to pay child support. He chose -not- to pay. He was NEVER prohibited from being involved. He had my phone number. I sent him picture and invited him to birthdays and other big celebrations. He never came.\n\nPSA: We are not in the US.\n\n**Verdict: Not the Asshole**\n&nbsp;\n\n[My daughter's father wants to use her as 'therapy' for his wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/LNFTOByIso): **December 31, 2023** \n\nI(33F) going to pre-face this by saying my six years old daughter's father(37M), I'm going to call him Jeff, has never been my romantic partner. We had a one night stand. I don't like people calling him my ex, since it makes it seem we had some kind of emotional attachement. He was never involved after I told him I was pregnant, and actually wanted me to terminate the pregnancy, but I decided to raise my child alone since I have enough money to raise her without child support.\n\nFor the whole pregnancy and the first four years, Jeff was not in the picture. On my mother's recommendation, I did send him pictures and invited him to special events, but he always replied he had no interest in my daughter. Two years ago he reappeared and began demanding parental rights. When I didn't do what he wanted, he sued, and was told no, he was not getting parental rights. He was given the offer to pay child support and then we can revisit giving him actual rights, but he has refused. He has the money, much more than me, but he refuses.\n\nI still offered to let him see my daughter in a casual manner, no child support needed, with the agreement anything legal, medical, or educational will not involve him. He pushed the boundaries and we had a fallout. After that, we didn't hear from him for almost 6 weeks before he called to meet for Christmas.\n\nAfter much discussion, I agreed to bring my daughter over on the condition my daughter's godparents could come. Thus we went over for christmas dinner. And finding out Jeff is married and had never told his family he had a child. It was great to be judged by a bunch of strangers.\n\nIt was uncomfortable the whole time. I'm going to use fake names, but let's say my daughter's name is Katie. His wife kept calling my daughter Gabrielle. Not the actual name she used, but it was that different to my daughter's name. The wife was also very physical, trying to pick up my daughter or parent her. I would block her or tell her to please let me deal with my child. The whole time she pretty much ignore me, but Katie didn't seem nervous so I decided to just bid my time.\n\nI hit my limit when my daughter said she needed the bathroom and this stranger went: \"Oh Gaby you need pottie? Let mommy change you.\"\n\nMy daughter hasn't worn diapers in a while now and she's more than capable of going alone to the bathroom. I immediately told her to stay away from my daughter and that we were leaving. The woman starting wailing that I was kidnapping her 'baby girl' and tried to lunge at me. Her in-laws got in the middle and hold her, consoling her and saying that we weren't leaving and for her to calm down like she was the victim.\n\nAt that point I just glared at Jeff and told him he better explain or I would be calling the police. He asked me to speak in private in another room and that I could just leave my daughter with his parents. No way that would ever happen. Katie's godparents took her with them despite the wife having a full meltdown.\n\nJeff and I spoke outside and he explained that he and his wife recently lost a daughter. I'm not going to give specific details on that, all I'll say it was sudden and nobody's fault. And as I can only imagine it had caused some psychological issues to his wife. Apparently he had the brilliant idea that having Katie pass as their lost child would help his wife. Without telling me. And that's why he wanted visitations and parental rights. He pleaded for me to leave my daughter with him for 'a little bit'. I asked him what was his plan when his wife 'heals'.\n\nHis response was disgusting: \"Well, I'll just send Katie back with you and it will be just like before.\"\n\nI told him he was insane if he thought I would let him use my daughter like that. What his wife needs is therapy with a professional, not feeding her delusions. And I would not let that woman within miles from my daughter. He told me I was being cruel and didn't know the pain of losing a child. I agreed with him, but reminded Jeff that my priority is not his family; it's my child. What he and his family do to work through their grief has nothing to do with us. I also told him to call his lawyer because I am making sure he never has contact with my child.\n\nSo that's what I'm bracing for. He's been blasting my phone since Christmas, but I can easily ignore him. My daughter and I are doing a small travel vacation.\n\nThis isn't an update, just something I feel needs to be said: My daughter is set for life monetarily. She has a trust and I make really good money in my position. If she was 18 right now, I could put her through college without a loan. She doesn't need child support for quality of life. If I could get child support and never worry about her father trying something, I would be suing him in a heartbeat. But after talking to a lawyer and realizing the risk, I've taken the decision that child support, or possible inheritance, is not worth my child's safety. SAFETY is always first.\n\n1/6/2024 Hey Everyone. Happy New's Years. This isn't so much a real update as just letting people know we are home and safe. My daughter is spending the rest of her vacation with her godparents on another trip while I work on things. Moving might be something I'll be looking into, though that is a long term plan considering all it takes. I won't share too many details on what my lawyer is going to be doing but we are absolutely going to push for an RO. I might not post for some time. At least not until things settled. I do appreciate all the support and good advice. I'm taking a lot of it into account as I plan how to move forward.\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/NGCZqNmVQK): **January 11, 2024** \n\nHey everyone, I decided to post a last update, since I will be going full silent for a long period.\n\nFor those that didn't know, I'm right now dealing with my daughter's father and his delusion. He wants to use my daughter as a 'therapy doll' for his wife that recently lost a child.\n\nA lot people were worried for my daughter and me, and I truly appreciate it. We're both safe, she's currently having a great vacation with her godparents, and I'm currently making my own arrangements to move on.\n\nMy lawyer is working hard on keeping everything in order. I know a cease and desist was his first action and we are going for no contact. He says we have a solid case and hopefully this will be resolve relatively fast. And by that I mean a year or two. We did get a temporary restraining order. It's only until our first court date, but after it could be extended.\n\nI haven't had direct contact with 'Jeff'. He lawyered up too and tried to send a threat to take full custody. My lawyer laughed at it since his reasoning was 'parental alienation'. Except I have proof I tried for years to have him involved. Apparently turning in a few emails showing my attempts was enough to get them to change 'parental alienation' to a different reasoning. My lawyer is not worried in all honesty.\n\nFor now I've decided after much thinking that moving is going to be necessary. It won't be something I can do on a whim, but I'll be looking into new houses within the month to hopefully move some time this year.\n\nSchool will remain the same, but we will be speaking to the admin to make sure only certain people can pick her up. And part of that decision has been to hire a private driver. He's someone I absolutely trust and has worked for relatives in the past, so I'm very comfortable with the idea and so is my daughter. Now I just have to make sure they don't go for fast food every day after school.\n\nThings in all honesty are not that scary right now. I have a good lawyer, good evidence, and my little girl is happy and healthy, so I'm just going to focus on working things little by little. Because of the legal procedings I don't think I'll be posting any updates any time soon.\n\nAnd to those sending me PMs telling me I'm horrible for keeping my daughter from her father, or telling me I shouldn't have had her in the first place, please kindly speak to the void. I'm too busy.\n&nbsp;\n\n[My daughter's father sent a priest to harass me](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/Dbx2x4uelv) – **March 26, 2024**\n\nI had no intentions to do a new post, but today absolutely took the cake.\n\nTo those that don't know, my daughter (6yo) was born from a one night stand with Jeff. We were never romantically involved. It was a simple one night stand and we did use contraceptives, but they failed. It happens. A few months ago Jeff went full psycho and tried to convince me to leave my daughter with him so she could serve as a replacement child for his wife who recently lost their infant daughter. I refused and right now we're in the middle of some legal issues.\n\nNow for today, I thankfully didn't deal with Jeff. Instead he sent a priest to harrass me at work.\n\nI'm going to be very blunt, I am completely detached from religion. I'm not an atheist, just don't really like the idea of the Catholic Church (that's the leading religion in my home country). I respect it and most of my family is Catholic so I have a detached respect for church officials.\n\nToday I was doing some paperwork when I got a call about a priest asking for me. I didn't have any meetings scheduled and a lot of times we get visits from clergy asking for donations or participation in events, so I figured that was it. I told the secretary to let him in and things at first seemed rather polite. Shake hands, asking how things were. The usual chit chat.\n\nThen the priest began talking about how it had come to his attention that I was a single woman with a child, and that apparently I lived a life of debauchery and hate. His words.\n\nI was taken aback and agreed I was a single mother, but that I didn't see how I lived in debauchery and hate.\n\nThe priest then went on about how he knew my daughter is prohibit from spending time with her father and that I'm constantly sleeping around with men instead of living a 'godly' life. How he was worried and thought it would be best I considered giving my daughter a chance to live with a proper family rather than see me sell myself.\n\nAngry was an understatement. I did keep it civil simply because I was at work and I had no intentions of screaming to a religious man at work. I simply told him that my daughter was fine with me, she lived a safe and happy life, my personal affairs were my own, and that I had no intentions of sending her to another household. I told him that if there was nothing else, he should probably leave as I had other things to attend to.\n\nHe then show his hand and that's how I know it was Jeff's doing. The priest told me he didn't think my daughter would be a happy child with me, but her FATHER was well respected in his church and he knew he would raise a proper Christian lady. At that I laugh, and simply said 'no'. I once again recommended he left and if he didn't, I would be calling security.\n\nHe left saying he would try to speak to me again when I'm not being 'hysterical'. I told my secretary and our security not to let him into my office again. And I called my lawyer. I don't have audio, but we do have security feed from him walking into my office.\n\nThank you again to everyone sending well wishes in my previous post. We are still working on that move, but school is back and she's loving it. We still have that temporary restraining order against Jeff and his wife. And school officials know it.\n&nbsp;\n\n---------------\n\n#----NEW UPDATES----\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/Q5LLJxuvaE): **June 12, 2024**\n\nHey Reddit.\n\nThis came up far earlier than planned, and while I'm happy to announce my daughter and I are finally free, there are some sad news mixed in.\n\nJust to recap: I (34F now) have a daughter (6F) with Jeff (37M). We never dated. It was a one night stand where protection failed. I never regret having my daughter despite Jeff demanding me to end the pregnancy, then refusing to be involved for my daughter's first 4 years of life. Two years ago, he reappeared demanding parental rights. Our country's courts deny it since he was not in her birth certificate (his decision) and he had never paid any kind of child support. Turned out he didn't care for my daughter, all he wanted was to use her as a replacement for a child he lost with his wife.\n\nNow, before I go to the update, I did get a lot of questions to answer:\n\n1. Did I know Jeff was married? He wasn't when we had our one night stand.\n\n2. Are you interested in Jeff? No. I'm Aromantic. Meaning I do no develop romantic feelings. I don't think that's a healthy mindset for a long term partner so I refuse to date. I was okay with one night stands until I had my daughter.\n\n3. Why did you send information to Jeff? Because my mother recommended it and she was absolutely right. Had I not done so, he could have sue me for parental alienation. By trying to get him involved, I actually came out far better situated to prove I'm not trying to keep him away out of spite, but because I truly think he's a danger.\n\n4. Why don't you talk more about your daughter's emotions/status? Um... no? No offense, but I give just enough information on my SIX years old. I don't think people in reddit are bad, but this is the internet. I don't really need to speak in-depth details on my child's mental state or her actions. What I want to share about myself, that's fine. I'm a full grown woman. My child is another matter. I don't even post pictures of her in social media. All you need to know, for the people asking, is she's happy, healthy, and has a father figure in her godfather. She's normal rambunctious little girl.\n\n5. Why was Jeff arrested? He got into a drunk fight. Assault charges. It's completely unrelated to my kid, but could have been used for custody matters. Ended up being unnecessary.\n\nNow, to the update.\n\nWhile our case has yet to be reviewed, we were scheduled for September 2025, Jeff's lawyer contacted mine to say they were dropping their demand for parental rights. About six weeks ago, Jeff formally agreed to drop any claims for rights or responsibility to my daughter. I know a lot of people are going to go all over 'but what about child support?! Or inheritance?!'. Keep reading, it should explain why it is not worth it.\n\nMy lawyer went over the documents to make sure it wasn't a legal trap of sort and he confirmed they were exactly that. He wasn't asking for anything in return, just to drop. I didn't question more, just had it signed and now we need to wait a couple of weeks to get confirmation everything is done. Since both parties agree on this, it should be relatively quick to get it through the courts.\n\nIf it sounds weird that he suddenly just gave up, I thought the same. To be sincere, I was half-tempted to snoop around, but I was way too busy making arrangements. As some people suggested, I will be moving. I won't leave the country I live in, but I plan to move closer to my support system, my daughter's godparents. Turns out there's a property less than 5 mins away from them on sale. There's no home built yet, so I have a lot to do, but that's my intended new home. We also got not one, not two, three dogs. The cat probably is planning my murder. So with all of these changes, I have to admit, I didn't have time to snoop.\n\nThe thing is, the whole thing came to me rather than me need to look. I met with Jeff's in-laws. It was pure coincidence, I waiting on some things in a store and they were there. I had met them in passing in that mess of a Christmas party last year, but this is really the first time we talked. My daughter was thankfully at school since the topic was heavy. They recognize me and ask if I could speak to them. I wasn't sure, but I decided to be polite and offered to buy them a coffee.\n\nThey were very nice. Not entitled at all. They explain they were sorry for their daughter's behavior. She had not been the same since she lost her child. Those who called out that she was using her dead baby's name on my daughter were right. And they just wanted to clear the air with me. I told them I didn't personally blamed them, but I couldn't forgive their daughter and she was a big worry. That's when things sh*t hit the fan. The mother started crying and the father explained Jeff's wife passed away. Self-inflicted. I feel like crap for the things I told them. I apologized, but they were very gracious and told me they knew I had no idea.\n\nWe talked a little about her, about their grandchild. I found out what Jeff told me about how his child died was a lie. And now I don't feel so kind as to keep it wrapped up. He shook an infant because she was colic. If you don't know what that is, its when babies just cry non-stop. I was angry. I'm still angry. No one should ever shake a baby to the point they pass away. That's just diabolical in my opinion. He had told me she just passed away from sudden infant mortality. It's a common thing here, unfortunately.\n\nThey talked about Jeff and how he sworn up and down I would agree with his idea to have my daughter pass for their lost grandchild. And that would help their daughter. They were not really thinking straight, and I get it. Jeff is a charmer and mix that with grief, it goes nowhere well.\n\nThere were other things said, but the main thing was they didn't want any resentment on my part to their family or their daughter. I told them that I don't hate them or their daughter, and how sorry I was they had to go through all of this. They gave me a picture of my daughter's half-sister. She was a very cute baby and I plan to one day explain things to my daughter. I think its important she knows. I also know where Jeff's wife and her baby are buried. I think not yet, but when things aren't as raw as they are right now I'll take my daughter to visit her sister.\n\nI called my lawyer after to give him these new details. He did reprimand me for speaking to the in-laws alone, but he understood the situation. My lawyer is a good friend of mine and he tends to be very blunt when I make mistakes. He promised me he's making sure that whatever ties could exist between Jeff and my daughter are fully cut legally.\n\nMore things have come to light too. People were right, Jeff was pretty much lying to everyone trying to paint himself as this saintly father that couldn't possibly be part of his one surviving daughter's life. A lot of people immediately judge single mothers here as 'homewreckers' or 'prostitutes', so I had a few bad encounters with people throwing insults and threats my way.\n\nAnother thing that came up, which was relatively recent. This was about two weeks before he gave up: Jeff began telling people he offered to marry me, but I refused him. That I was always after his money. Thankfully that one lie didn't go far with most people that know both of us, since I've made it very clear throughout my life that I'm never getting married. And I don't need his money. I got into a high income job to care for my mom. And now my daughter. I don't really care for excessive luxury.\n\nHis wife passed away not long before he sent the agreement he didn't want anything to do with my daughter. It does explain why Jeff gave up. I still think he's the most horrible human being that exists. And entitled murderous bastard. He felt entitled to my daughter, he failed his wife, and killed an innocent baby. And I know he knows I'm posting this on reddit, so if you read this Jeff, I hope if karma real it gives you everything you deserve. I want to say more, but I don't want to break reddit's rules.\n\nBut yeah, here's the good news mixed with terrible news. I might update this post if anything else happens, but I want to believe this is over. I just want to close this chapter and look into a new start.\n\nSmall disclaimer: -I- don't know how he got away with killing his child. I have no access to police records or investigation. I'm not part of law enforcement or involved with any judicial entity. For people asking me for more information on it, I'm really sorry, but I can't give you a full legal case. I personally don't know how some people in reddit get access to police records that easily, because I certainly don't have access to them. All the info I have is what I'm told by others (chisme) or what my lawyer can find.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on why Jeff is not in jail**\n \n> **OOP:** I can't tell you for sure. You have to understand I'm going from what the in-laws told me and what I know of Jeff. I'm not a detective. My guess? He either paid his way out or made it seem it was an accident. As far as anyone I've met that knows about his kid, they thought the same as me. She died suddenly in her sleep. I don't doubt the in-laws tho. It sounds like something Jeff would do at this point.\n\n**OOP on her country’s laws**\n\n> **OOP:** We're not in the US first of all. American law isn't a thing here. Here, a good bribe to the right person makes a lot of things go away.\n\n+\n\n> All I'll say is Latin America. I've explained in my past posts I don't share my specific country for privacy reasons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**OOP updates in the same post** \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/Q5LLJxuvaE): **September 15, 2024**\n\nWell, it's been three months and good news all around. To begin with, we're finally free of Jeff. Life is pretty much back to normal. My daughter only asked about Jeff once when we went to the park we would meet him at and it was to make sure 'Mister' was not there. We also went together to her baby sister's grave. I explained to her as best as I could. I don't think she understands yet what the situation with her half-sister is, but we will go through it little by little.\n\nAnother big change is I'm dating someone. And no, I'm still Aromantic. My bestfriend who's been in the US until recently came back and asked me out. When I told him I was Aromantic, he told me there was no pressure for romantic feelings. He just wanted a partner he could trust and while this isn't a traditional relationship, it's really nice. I adore him as a friend even if I don't see him in any romantic way. He's met my daughter, but we're not doing anything official like moving in for a very long time.\n\nThrough the grapevine I heard Jeff is apparently engaged again too. I think it was a very good thing we made that no contact agreement. If he ever tries anything with my daughter, that piece of paper will be enough for court to tell him to go away.\n\nOverall we're happy and safe. I'm grateful for all the support here through the hell that was dealing with Jeff.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**"

I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)*\n\nTLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to \"cover\" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.\n\nThere’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.\n\nThe first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nPlummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nThe second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nThe way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.\n\nThe tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.\n\nThe SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\n\nThe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:\n\n* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.\n* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.\n* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.\n* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.\n* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.\n* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.\n\nIt gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.\n\nBelow is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:\n\n***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**\n\n\\*\\*\n\nIn short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.\n\nThese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.\n\nIf this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes \"its only a loss when you sell.\" The version for shorts would be \"its only a loss if you close out your short positions.\"\n\nAnother factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)\n\nIn addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.\n\nI would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.\n\nIn considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.\n\n**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)\n\n**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)\n\nSidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the \"new\" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.\n\nIf you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.\n\nThere's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay \"retarded\" longer than funds can stay solvent. The \"paper hand\" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)\n\nAt least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:\n\n* **\"Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.\"** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.\n* **\"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.\"** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.\n* **\"If his forces are united, separate them\"** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving \"weak-hands\" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some \"paper hands\", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.\n\nI will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further.

So if I’ve gotten something hilariously wrong or if you’ve spotted any wild connections I missed, feel free to jump in and give me the ol’ “Actually...” treatment.\n\nFirst off, this isn’t me trying to start some fear-pocalypse. Let’s keep this a chill, fun discussion or at least as fun as discussing potentially mind-bending, reality-breaking events can be. Because, honestly, the stuff happening around us right now is freakishly similar to the plot of the show. Could we be in the middle of a slow, strategic \"drip campaign,\" getting humanity ready for something huge? You know, the kind of thing that makes you wonder if it’s time to invest in a bunker.\n\n# The Uncanny Relevance of The Three-Body Problem\n\nFor those not in the know, *The Three-Body Problem* is a wild ride where humanity discovers an advanced alien civilization—the Trisolarans—living in an unstable star system. But here’s where it gets spicy: the Trisolarans have been pulling strings behind the scenes on Earth, manipulating humanity long before their RSVP to the invasion party. Governments? Totally in on it. They’re slow-dripping information, trying not to send everyone into full-blown freak-out mode while we wrestle with existential threats like, \"Should I get a bunker or watch the new season of *Love Is Blind UK*?\"\n\n[***The Three-Body Problem*** **Book on Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032)\n\n[***The Three-Body Problem*** **on Netflix**](https://www.google.com/search?q=3+Body+Problem&sca_esv=a5d552cd31a5e255&sca_upv=1&ei=cFHsZt7hFsXt5NoPm4nlqQI&ved=0ahUKEwje2aPtts-IAxXFNlkFHZtEOSUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=3+Body+Problem&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDjMgQm9keSBQcm9ibGVtMggQLhiABBixAzIKEC4YgAQYQxiKBTIKEAAYgAQYQxiKBTINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBTINEC4YgAQYsQMYQxiKBTIKEAAYgAQYQxiKBTINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBTIFEAAYgAQyDRAAGIAEGLEDGEMYigUyChAAGIAEGEMYigUyKRAuGIAEGLEDGJcFGNwEGN4EGOAEGPQDGPEDGPUDGPYDGPcDGPgD2AEBSPQjULQGWJcccAN4AZABAJgBZ6AB9QeqAQQxNC4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAISoAL-CMICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFwgIOEAAYsAMY5AIY1gTYAQHCAhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AEBwgIOEC4YgAQYxwEYjgUYrwHCAgsQLhiABBixAxiDAcICLhAuGIAEGLEDGEMYigUYlwUY3AQY3gQY4AQY9AMY8QMY9QMY9gMY9wMY-APYAQHCAggQABiABBixA8ICCxAAGIAEGJIDGIoFwgIIEAAYgAQYyQPCAgUQLhiABMICDBAuGIAEGEMYigUYCsICCxAuGIAEGMcBGK8BwgItEC4YgAQYQxiKBRgKGJcFGNwEGN4EGOAEGPQDGPEDGPUDGPYDGPcDGPgD2AEBwgIKEC4YgAQYsQMYCsICChAAGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQLhiABBgKwgIHEAAYgAQYCsICKxAuGIAEGLEDGAoYlwUY3AQY3gQY4AQY9AMY8QMY9QMY9gMY9wMY-APYAQHCAikQLhiABBixAxiXBRjcBBjeBBjgBBj0AxjxAxj1Axj2Axj3Axj4A9gBAZgDAIgGAZAGE7oGBggBEAEYCZIHBDE2LjKgB67pAg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)\n\n# James Webb's Mysterious Discoveries\n\nSo, there’s some serious buzz right now that the James Webb Space Telescope might’ve found something *big*. Big enough to prompt a private briefing to Congress. We’re talking potential techno-signatures—like “city lights” on a planet 4.9 light-years away. Oh, and there's also chatter about an object out there making course corrections, which is the universal sign for, \"Hey, we're not just space debris.\"\n\n[**Watch more about the James Webb Discovery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFKmcqcBbnw&t=857s)\n\n[**Vetted Talks About James Webb Discovery Details \"Non-Human Object\" Headed For Earth?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ7xwyiu8XE)\n\n# The Sudden Surge Toward AGI—Preparation for Something Bigger?\n\nLeopold Aschenbrenner from OpenAI thinks AGI by 2027 is “strikingly plausible” (which sounds suspiciously like “buckle up!”). Meanwhile, Jensen Huang from Nvidia casually drops that AI is now designing new AI at a pace of “Moore’s Law squared,” like that’s not the most terrifyingly cool thing you’ve ever heard.\n\nIDK It just doesn’t feel like we’re just trying to build smarter machines. Maybe—just maybe—we’re getting ready for something *else.* I mean the timing’s a little too coincidental, don’t you think? The same year AGI might come online is the same year we keep hearing whispers about potential *disclosure*? I mean, what are the odds? Is 2027 just the year everything levels up—AI, aliens, and my inability to process it all?\n\n[**OpenAI Believes AGI by 2027?**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/agi-by-2027)\n\n[**Jensen Huang from Nvidia talks about AI**](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1fjxdet/jensen_huang_says_technology_has_reached_a/)\n\n# Are Hidden Forces Slowing Down Scientific Progress? (Or Is Science Just Stuck in a Really Long Traffic Jam?)\n\nIn *The Three-Body Problem*, the Trisolarans—an alien race chilling out 4.37 light-years away in the Alpha Centauri system—catch wind of Earth and decide to invade. Even with their advanced tech, they can't travel faster than light. So, it’s going to take them about 450 years to get here. That’s right, we’ve got almost half a millennium to prepare. Now, the Trisolarans’ big worry? That humanity will advance so much in those centuries that by the time they roll up, we’ll be way ahead of them, zipping around in quantum spaceships while they’re still stuck with sub-light drives. To keep this from happening, they send over sophons—AI-powered particles designed to sabotage our scientific progress, specifically in fundamental physics, and keep us from reaching their level by the time they arrive.\n\nSo while their fleet is en route, we’re stuck in a bit of a scientific chokehold. But instead of throwing in the towel, humanity pivots. We start pushing forward in other areas—space engineering, AI, mechanical systems—the stuff the sophons can’t mess with. The novel’s all about this long, 450-year waiting game, where we’re prepping for an inevitable invasion while trying to outsmart the cosmic curveball we’ve been thrown.\n\nNow, if you really want to get speculative, could something like this be happening in our world? Think about it: since 1973, we’ve been stuck in particle physics while other areas—like AI and tech—are advancing at a breakneck pace. Even [**Eric Weinstein on The Joe Rogan Podcast** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAhUWbeolDY)has pointed out how fundamental physics has stalled, despite decades of work on theories like string theory. Maybe it’s just a coincidence. Or maybe, like in *The Three-Body Problem*, there’s some hidden force—our own modern-day \"sophons\"—holding us back, quietly hitting the brakes on scientific breakthroughs while we unknowingly prep for something *bigger*.\n\n# \"The Collins Elite\" and Their Role in Shaping Disclosure\n\nIn *The Three-Body Problem*, some humans, completely freaked out by the idea of getting wiped out by the Trisolarans, think their best move is to team up with the aliens. Enter the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO)—a group convinced that surrendering to an advanced civilization is humanity’s only shot at survival. Of course, the Trisolarans see these collaborators as expendable pawns.\n\nNow, shift to real life: ever heard of *The Collins Elite*? According to [**Nick Redfern’s book** ***Final Events***](https://www.amazon.com/EVENTS-Secret-Government-Demonic-Afterlife/dp/1933665483) and whispers from guys like Ross Coulthart and Lou Elizondo, the Collins Elite is this ultra-secretive group within the U.S. government that believes alien phenomena aren’t just aliens—they’re *demonic*. That’s right, these guys are convinced we’re not just dealing with little green men but literal forces of darkness. And their job? Block any public disclosure of this terrifying info.\n\nIt’s kind of like the ETO in *The Three-Body Problem*, where different factions have their own wild ideas about aliens. But if groups like the Collins Elite are real, and they’re operating behind closed doors with their own hidden agendas, what else could be happening behind the scenes? Secret factions? Private entities with their own motives? Maybe even deals being made with extraterrestrial beings?\n\nThis could explain why some fields of science—like particle physics—have felt stagnant since the 1970s, while AI is advancing like they’ve got a cheat code. Maybe, just maybe, certain groups are steering the scientific ship, funneling resources into areas they can control or profit from, while quietly suppressing discoveries that could trigger existential chaos. It’s like those modern-day “sophons” from *The Three-Body Problem*—keeping humanity’s most dangerous ideas locked away while they play a long game for control.\n\nBut here’s a question that’ll keep you up at night: If the Collins Elite thinks UFOs are demonic, then where are the angels? Shouldn’t we be teaming up with the good guys? I mean, if we’re diving headfirst into the supernatural, why not place our bets on the winged heroes? It’s like we’re stuck in the weirdest reality show ever—one we didn’t exactly sign up for but can’t stop watching.\n\n*For more on these mind-bending ideas, go down the rabbit hole with* \n\n[***Jesse Michaels’*** **American Alchemy: The CIA Scientist Who Built REAL UFOs.** ***Because if you’re not already questioning everything, you will be soon.***](https://www.reddit.com/r/NobeWon/comments/1f53pcb/why_do_the_collins_elite_think_ufos_are_demonic/)\n\n# Ross Coulthart on Apocalyptic Events and Pole Reversals (Or Why You Should Probably Buy That Bunker, Just in Case)\n\nRoss Coulthart, investigative journalist extraordinaire, has shared some pretty unsettling tidbits about potential apocalyptic scenarios. In one interview, Coulthart mentioned that his sources have hinted at catastrophic possibilities, including a *magnetic pole reversal*. Now, he admits he’s no scientist and doesn’t fully get how flipping the poles could trigger geological chaos, but apparently, it's a hot topic among researchers. And when Coulthart drops a line like, “**What I’ve been told would cause panic if I said it,”** that’s about the time you start wondering if there’s an Airbnb for bunkers, because I’d like a cozy underground option with Wi-Fi, please.\n\nAnd there’s more:[ **Earth’s magnetic north has been shifting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeTheory/comments/1azyk8x/why_is_the_magnetic_north_pole_moving_so_fast/) faster than my commitment to a New Year’s resolution ever since it was first measured in 1903. Some experts are now biting their nails, fearing this could lead to a full magnetic pole reversal. While the exact outcome is up for debate, a few nightmare-fuel theories suggest it could happen in a “snap,” which could bring:\n\n* 1500 mph winds that’d basically give the Earth a power wash.\n* Massive tectonic freak-outs.\n* A total reshuffling of geography and weather, where only folks chilling near the new equator might have a shot at not freezing solid.\n\nOn the flip side, some optimists think it might be a gentler process. Still, even the “less violent” version could leave us scrambling as climate patterns go haywire, with much of the planet turning into a deep freeze.\n\nCoulthart also threw in a fun twist: the solar maximum, expected in 2024, could line up perfectly with a pole reversal. Now, imagine a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun hitting us right when Earth’s magnetic field is on vacation. We’re talking power grid failures, satellites gone haywire, and communication breakdowns that would leave us staring at blank screens.\n\n[**\"What I've been told would cause panic if I said it\"** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1aezoh5/ross_coulthart_there_is_a_real_mood_of_apocalypse/)\n\n[***Check out Ross Coulthart’s full comments here***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM3kxeU_oDE)\n\n# Leslie Kean’s Distressing Outlook \n\nLeslie Kean, the journalist known for blowing minds with her work on UFO disclosure, dropped some seriously unsettling comments during her interview on *Theories of Everything* with Curt Jaimungal. Kean seemed pretty convinced that the near future is going to be dramatically different from the comfy little world we know today. And the way she said it? Let’s just say her clear distress didn’t exactly leave me feeling warm and fuzzy.\n\n[**Watch the full discussion here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1fN5Gxm9fk) if you’re in the mood for some existential dread.\n\nWhen Curt pressed her for details about what’s got her spooked, Kean tried steering the convo towards the usual suspects—climate change and geopolitical chaos. But her vague answers? They had that “I know something I can’t say” vibe, like a secret she’s been sworn to keep. She hinted that her sources, much like those whispering to Ross Coulthart, have warned her about looming troubles—possibly even a catastrophic pole shift. Fun times, right?\n\nHere’s a key moment: Curt Jaimungal: *\"Okay, I'm gonna hold you to that within a decade.\"* Leslie Kean: *\"Oh definitely… it better happen before that. I don't think we're going to be in any shape in a decade to be doing very much of anything, so I’m not hopeful for the future direction that we’re moving in.\"* Jaimungal: *\"And the future direction climate-wise, AI-wise?\"* Kean: *\"Climate-wise and geopolitical-wise. I think things are going to be pretty difficult, starting in a few years. From what I've been told by my sources.\"*\n\nWhen asked if these \"difficulties\" could affect things like, oh, I don’t know, *electricity*, Kean didn’t exactly wave it off. She hinted that some of the comforts we rely on today might not be so sustainable in the not-so-distant future. Her grim outlook paints a picture of a world on the edge of some big, uncomfortable changes—whether it’s climate, global politics, or something more out of left field.\n\nKean’s reluctance to spill the full tea, combined with the implied knowledge of *something* troubling on the horizon, makes it feel like we’re in the slow-burn buildup to a real-world crisis.\n\n# Lou Elizondo's Cryptic Comments\n\nLou Elizondo, the former Pentagon insider, UAP whisperer, and now a NY Times best selling author for his new book [**“Imminent”**](https://www.amazon.com/Imminent-Pentagons-Responsible-Investigating-Profound/dp/0063235560) recently dropped a cryptic little nugget on *The Good Trouble Show*. When asked about some mysterious upcoming event, he said, \"I am aware of it, but that is not my conversation to have.\" Now, I don’t know about you, but that’s the kind of comment that makes me want to throw my popcorn at the screen. What exactly *isn’t* Lou telling us? The suspense is real.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, there’s more. Elizondo also mentioned that U.S. Navy submarines have encountered massive objects underwater—objects bigger than the 600ft subs themselves—zooming around at 400-500 knots. Which, if you’re keeping track, is fast enough to make you go, *“WTF”* \n\n[**Watch Lou on The Good Trouble Show if you enjoy cryptic teases and undersea UFOs**](https://www.youtube.com/live/E6YUCSDJhp4)**.**\n\nLou also popped up on the *Theories of Everything* podcast with Curt Jaimungal, where he casually mentioned that ***The Three-Body Problem*** **might just be soft disclosure.** You know, because nothing says “heads up, something’s coming” like a best-selling sci-fi novel. He said, *“Imagine a scenario where we have 50 years to prepare for something, but now that the cat is out of the bag, that exceptional will happen tomorrow.”* So, yeah, that cat’s not just out of the bag—it’s sprinting straight into our living rooms.\n\n[**Catch Lou on Theories of Everything—if you’re ready to start prepping for tomorrow’s “exceptional.”**](https://x.com/TheUfoJoe/status/1626008165467979776)\n\n# John Lear’s Prophetic Warning in 1989 (The Original “I Told You So” in the UFO World)\n\nWay back in 1989, UFO whistleblower John Lear sat down with George Knapp and dropped a bombshell: something *big* involving extraterrestrial contact was on the horizon. At the time, it probably sounded like science fiction on steroids, but looking at where we are now—with UAP revelations, space discoveries, and government transparency (sort of)—Lear’s words are starting to feel a whole lot more like prophecy. It’s like he was setting up the slowest drip campaign in history. So, the real question is: was the groundwork for today’s big UFO revelations actually laid decades ago?\n\n[**Check out Lear’s interview here (Start at 6:30)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meacG87goVM&t=344s)\n\n# John Ramirez's 2027 Prediction\n\nJohn Ramirez, a former CIA officer who seems to know a thing or two about secrets, has dropped a tantalizing hint that something *big* is coming in 2027. According to him, the U.S. government has a five-year deadline (starting from 2022) to get the public ready for whatever this monumental event is. Sounds a bit like the slow-burn prep from *The Three-Body Problem*, where governments eased everyone into the idea of first contact—except here we don’t get centuries to prepare. We get five years. No pressure.\n\nAnd the fact that more than one insider is circling 2027 as a crucial year? Yeah, that feels like a red flag. \n\n[**Check out Ramirez’s interview here (Start at 6:47)** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meacG87goVM&t=344s)\n\n# Phil Schneider's Project Blue Beam Prediction for 2027\n\nPhil Schneider, a controversial figure in the UFO and conspiracy world, made waves with his prediction about a secret operation known as *Project Blue Beam*. According to Schneider, 2027 is the year when this mysterious event is supposed to go down. But here’s the twist: Project Blue Beam allegedly involves a *staged* alien invasion—yep, a fake one—designed to manipulate the global population and maybe even bring in a shiny new world order. Sounds like the plot of a sci-fi thriller, except Schneider was dead serious.\n\nNow, whether you believe Schneider or not, the fact that more than a few people are pointing to 2027 as a “big year” certainly raises some eyebrows. Real extraterrestrial contact or a manufactured hoax, the idea that governments are gearing up for a monumental shift involving UFOs or alien life feels like we’re all living in a slow-motion trailer for a movie we didn’t ask to see.\n\nThere are conspiracies swirling around Schneider’s death, with many claiming he didn’t die of natural causes. Some think he knew *too* much about Project Blue Beam and, well, you can guess the rest.\n\n[**Check out this Documentary About Phil Schneider**](https://tubitv.com/movies/583199/the-underground-director-s-cut)\n\n# The Letter to Art Bell and Linda Moulton Howe (1996)\n\nOne of the more mind-bending clues in the extraterrestrial mystery world came way back in 1996—yeah, while we were busy with *Friends* and *Tamagotchis*. A letter, sent to radio legend Art Bell and researcher Linda Moulton Howe, arrived with a little something extra: alleged *artifacts* tied to the Roswell incident. And what did the letter claim? Full-on contact between humans and extraterrestrials was expected around... drumroll, please... 2025. Two years is close enough to 2027, right?\n\nThe letter mentions a “transition.” It also talks about these *artifacts* being made from metals that are almost indistinguishable from Earth materials. Why? Because the aliens were apparently smart enough to avoid leaving behind anything too alien-looking if it got into human hands. Classic overachievers. And, as a bonus, the letter explains how these alien ships (or “probeships”) were built using materials that could dodge detection by our radar systems.\n\n[**For anyone wanting to dive deeper into this, you can check out more details here**](https://twitter.com/kentbye/status/1186323993411776513?lang=en)\n\n# Chris Bledsoe and \"The Lady's\" 2026/2027 Prophecy\n\nChris Bledsoe, a well-known UAP experiencer who’s caught the attention of some seriously credible researchers, has been getting messages from an entity he calls *The Lady*. Sounds mystical, right? Well, according to Bledsoe, The Lady told him that something *big* is going down in late 2026 or early 2027—a moment that will bring “new knowledge for mankind.” Now, whether that means disclosure, a mass alien contact event, or something else that’ll have us all Googling “What’s the appropriate attire for meeting extraterrestrials?” is still up in the air.\n\n[**Bledsoe Verifies The 2026/2027 Event**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AHeadStart/comments/1dmj513/experiencer_chris_bledsoe_recently_clarified_his/)\n\n# Bashar's Predictions: 2026/2027 Full-Scale Contact\n\nOne more fascinating prediction comes from Darryl Anka, who channels an entity named Bashar. Now, Bashar doesn’t make a lot of predictions—only when there’s a 95% chance something’s actually going down. So when Bashar says that aliens are set to announce themselves to humanity by late 2026 or early 2027 (unless we somehow completely derail the timeline), you might want to start taking that seriously. Or, at the very least, consider brushing up on your intergalactic etiquette.\n\nAccording to Bashar, full-scale contact is coming soon, and unless something drastic changes in our trajectory, by 2027 we could be rolling out the welcome mat for our new alien friends.\n\n[**Darryl Anka on Bashar’s Prediction—They’ll Be Here Soon!** ](https://youtu.be/mvmEBxlPzfo?si=wMTwVLF-I3uG1NVD)\n\n[**Darryl Anka on Bashar's Prediction - The Public Will Finally Know**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wqaCmoSXMA)\n\n# Steven Greer: \"The Jig is Up\" in the Secret Government \n\nSteven Greer has been stirring the pot, claiming that big shifts are happening behind the curtain within the secret government, especially when it comes to UFOs and extraterrestrial disclosure. According to Greer, “the jig is up”—meaning the decades-long cloak-and-dagger act surrounding UAPs, reverse-engineered tech, and those oh-so-mysterious alien contacts is starting to unravel faster than your Gen Z girlfriends attempt at knitting a sweater.\n\nGreer hints that key players in these secretive programs are scrambling, moving assets, and bracing for what seems inevitable.\n\n# God of Chaos\" Apophis: A Near Miss or Catastrophic Impact in 2029? The Truth Awaits in 2027 (Or Why Billionaires Are Already Booking Their Bunkers)\n\nOne big, rock-shaped concern on the horizon is Asteroid Apophis, set to swing by in 2029. Originally, this 370-meter-wide behemoth had scientists fearing a direct impact with Earth. But, as of now, it looks like we’re getting a near miss... *phew*. The only catch? Apophis will zip by closer than some of our satellites. So, while a direct hit is looking less likely, there’s still a touch of “Wait, what if?” hanging in the air.\n\nWe won’t know for sure until 2027 if Apophis is sticking to its non-impact plans. That’s right—*2027* strikes again.\n\n[**Asteroid Apophis: Cosmic Close Call or Doomsday Delivery?**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/13/asteroid-apophis-hit-earth-2029-possible-study/75192091007/) \n\n[**Billionaires Are Building Bunkers—What Do They Know?**](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/doomsday-luxury-bunkers/index.html)\n\n# The 80-Year Cycle: Are We Heading Toward a New Era of Crisis and Rebirth?\n\nThe Strauss-Howe generational theory, aka the \"Four Turnings\" theory, is basically the universe's way of saying, “History’s on repeat.” According to this framework, society goes through four distinct generational phases, each lasting about 20 to 25 years, adding up to a full 80-to-85-year cycle. \n\nHere’s the rundown: The first generation—the \"Hero\" crew—comes in hot after a crisis, building institutions and systems to prevent future disasters. The second generation, the \"Artist,\" shows up and asks, \"Are we sure about these systems?\" and slowly starts weakening them. By the time the third generation, the \"Nomad,\" rolls in, they’re like, “Yeah, these institutions are broken,” and it’s all about individualism. Then comes the fourth season: the \"Fourth Turning,\" where everything goes haywire. Institutions crumble, chaos reigns, and society has to rebuild from the ashes. It’s like the season finale of history, complete with destruction, revolution, or war—and, of course, a rebirth of a shiny new societal order.\n\nThe fascinating part? This theory nails why major crises and cultural shifts tend to show up like clockwork. Big moments like the American Revolution, the Civil War, and World War II fit perfectly into this cycle. And, spoiler alert: according to this theory, we’re now entering another \"Fourth Turning.\"\n\n# Conclusion: A Monumental Shift Is Coming, and the Clues Are All Around Us \n\nAs we start to connect the dots it’s getting pretty hard to shake the feeling that something big is coming.\n\nAre we gearing up for first contact with an alien civilization? Or is this slow drip of revelations setting us up for something else—like a technological singularity, a massive global reset, or a shift in human consciousness?\n\nIt’s like we’re characters in a story that’s rapidly approaching its climax. The signs are there. The parallels are striking. And maybe, just maybe, *The Three-Body Problem* hasn’t just been a novel—it’s been a mirror, reflecting a reality we’re inching closer to every day.\n\nNow, this isn’t about fear-mongering—no one’s suggesting we all start panic-buying canned beans (although it wouldn’t hurt). It’s about staying aware, open, and curious. Let’s keep the conversation going, share insights, and piece together this unfolding narrative. Because when the moment finally arrives—whether it’s in 2027 or another curveball of a year—we’ll have seen the signs, connected the dots, and hopefully be ready to face whatever comes next.\n\nPopcorn, anyone?"

This could be the whole scam.\n\n**TLDR:** HODL. Simple as that. HODL and the shorts have no way to escape. They just writhe around in desperation as FTDs escalate, their options expire and New DTCC rulings approach. To support this belief I:\n\n* Built an AI to detect Deep ITM calls used to create naked shares. ***140M naked shares*** produced this way since Jan. Deep ITM call covering appears to be their *last resort of illegal desperation*. It's so easy to spot.\n* Investigated married put naked shorting. At the Jan mini-squeeze put open interest went wild and aligns with *the creation of millions of naked shares with married put trades*. Put volumes appear to be sustained at higher levels to keep rolling over FTDs. ***Up to 400M naked shares created in total***.\n* Looked through all 13F filings for funds with large GME positions (long/short). We have a clear idea of who is on which side of this battle and what a true idiot short position looks like (hint: Melvin).\n* Gathered all Dark Pool trading data from FINRA and show massive changes in trade behaviour since Jan. Huge increases in shares traded, but each trade is of few shares. And the key players? Known short funds. Supportive evidence for *naked short trades and suppression of retail buy pressure*.\n\nI encourage you to read the post and take a look at the data so you can understand it for yourself. Correct me if I'm wrong somewhere. My suggestions? HODL with patience. Take a break from ticker watching. Take a walk outside. The shorts cannot escape  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n*^(Note: this is not financial advice. I am not a cat. I read gathered some data, made some figures and tried to understand them. Any number of my interpretations could be flawed and wrong. Do your own research, make your own mind up.)*\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn this post I build an AI to detect suspicious Deep ITM Calls volumes used to hide FTDs. Take a look at historical options data to show recent fuckery in the options consistent with naked shorting tricks. And then compare these trends with Dark Pool trading volumes by known short funds.\n\nThe post will be broken down into the following sections:\n\n1. An AI to [detect Deep ITM calls](https://preview.redd.it/4g8izd9godu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0dc2f3937cb050458b23c7f46b79ffd10f0f3a) used to hide FTDs\n2. A recap of the major short funds and their recent positions\n3. A recap of naked short selling and the married put\n4. Options fuckery consistent with naked shorting and the married put\n5. Dark Pool matters\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe motivation for the work was to try and test a number of predictions I made in my [first post on the naked shorting scam and the married put trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/).\n\nThese are the main ideas I wanted to test or at least find additional data to support or disprove them:\n\n* short interest is manipulated through naked shorting\n* the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) might be due to naked short selling\n* short shares are 'washed' and able to be dumped on the market even during SSR\n* the large number of way out of the money calls seen recently are actually part of a naked short trick\n* increased trades in OTC / Dark Pools are due to naked shorting and price manipulation\n\nI've gathered a lot of data to better understand these questions. I believe that some of the data is now conclusive. Other areas more supportive. But the big message is that shorts have no way out and never had a chance to cover 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n# An AI to detect Deep ITM calls used to hide FTDs\n\nWhen a share is sold without being owned or borrowed (located) it is sold naked, a \"naked short\". This can happen as part of normal market activity by market makers and I've described [this process and how it can be abused in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh6lnz/the_naked_shorting_scam_update_selling_nude_like/). When this occurs the SEC has clear guidelines on how long the seller has to find a share and deliver it to the buyer. If a share is not located in time it must be reported as a Fail to Deliver (FTD). Funds that have FTDs outstanding are required to resolve the position within a given timeframe and are restricted from selling short until then. I won't go into all the details on this but point you towards [the God Tier DD](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/GME/) that covers this.\n\nOne way that a naked short seller can 'resolve' their FTDs without actually covering is through options fuckery. Deep in-the-money (ITM) calls can be bought and exercised immediately to acquire the shares and close the FTDs. [The SEC published a paper on this ILLEAGAL practice](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\n\n[Other great DD has been posted showing when Deep ITM volumes have been used to cover FTDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/).\n\nI wanted to train a machine learning algorithm (often called an AI) that could automatically identify this illegal fuckery and point us towards what exactly has been going on with GME this last year and particularly since Jan 2021. I won't go into the full details here. I've made [a separate post describing all the details of the classifier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwrycd/how_to_train_a_binary_classifier_ai_to_detect/).\n\n* End of day options data for all strike prices between Jan 1st 2020 and April 6th 2021 was collected\n* I manually labelled more than 10,000 rows of data from mid-Jan to mid-Feb for suspicious volumes likely due to FTD hiding\n* Labelled data was used to train different classifiers (AIs) reserving 30% of the data for testing\n* The best classifier (BalancedBagging-Adaboost) has an accuracy score of 91%\n* I used the model to identify all Deep ITM call options fuckery in the last year\n\nTHE AI FOUND EVIDENCE FOR MORE THEN 140 MILLION FTDs BEING HIDDEN SINCE JANUARY!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AI detection of option volumes used to hide FTDs and FTD values since January.](https://preview.redd.it/4g8izd9godu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0dc2f3937cb050458b23c7f46b79ffd10f0f3a)\n\nThe above figure shows all the suspicious Deep ITM call volumes since January as coloured bars. The colour scheme shows the different strike prices that were used for the trade. FTDs as % of float are drawn on top in the blue line.\n\nAs FTDs were spiking and the situation became more and more unsustainable for the shorts towards the end of Jan ILLEAGAL Deep ITM options purchasing was used to naked short and cover FTDs. Smaller increases in Deep ITM volumes also occurred just before FTD spikes at the end of Feb and mid-Feb.\n\nOn Jan 27th 25 MILLION shares were magically acquired using this trick. 140 MILLION in total since Jan 1st.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Running total of suspicious call volumes since Jan 1st. 140 million as of April 6th.](https://preview.redd.it/30b6h4qopdu61.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccafaf7bca99b134b09931bd5a60f11428c190ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AI detection of option volumes used to hide FTDs and GME price since January.](https://preview.redd.it/m0pd5pwwpdu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cefe0ef8b62b0ca853322c3e4c8b57205e5b641)\n\nHere we see that suspicious Deep ITM call volumes often precede big price increases. This suggests that this illegal trick is used as a last resort. It's so easy to see even by eye when looking at the options chains. When shorts get desperate they go to the deep calls.\n\n[AI detection of option volumes used to hide FTDs and Short Interest \\(SI&#37;\\) since January.](https://preview.redd.it/3tk1ye2jqdu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d77b931096e9f42d111565bf550c5639070b6bca)\n\nWe see that Short Interest (SI%) decreased massively after all of the suspicious call option activity in late Jan. As well as getting the FTDs under control the suspicious Deep ITM call volumes might have been used to close legitimately borrowed shares to hide the true SI%.\n\nWith all the hype and attention the shorts knew they were completely fucked if they couldn't get everyone to believe it was over. But as we've seen after the lows of Feb this ride is far from over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AI detection of option volumes used to hide FTDs and Short Interest \\(SI&#37;\\) since April 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/8mfwrbx6tdu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd2e26293f59af8d438169bead8b5f46a426d51)\n\nFinally, if we look back over the past year very few suspicious Deep ITM call volumes were occurring. This changed in January 2021 as the FTDs started to get out of control and a huge amount of hype followed the price rises. This again makes me believe that the suspicious Deep ITM call volumes are a sign of desperation from the shorts.\n\n**Speculation alert:** Deep ITM calls are bought in times of desperation by the shorts when FTDs, price and/or SI% are getting out of control. At the end of Jan more than 100 million naked short shares were created this way to hide FTDs, hammer down price and hide SI%. Through Feb and up until April another 40 million naked short shares were created this way when the shorts began to lose control of their hidden positions.\n\n# A recap of the major short funds and their recent positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0cx2nq85eu61.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18900ca805bc55c1372d3d2a39d098c4c6d4a803\n\n>Regulation SHO stocks with large, unsettled trades often exhibit a similar characteristic: *“short selling” hedge funds with significant put holdings in 13F filings*.  \n>  \n>MARRIED PUTS, REVERSE CONVERSIONS AND ABUSE OF THE OPTIONS MARKET MAKER EXCEPTION ON THE CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE  \n>  \n>John W Welborn, EconomistThe Haverford Group October 9, 2007\n\nIn my earlier post [The naked shorting scam revealed](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) one thing that struck me was coming across the above quote. So I've gone though all the latest 13F filings that contain GME on [whalewisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com) to get a clearer picture of the enemy. Note: the last 13F filings were made on December 31st 2020.\n\nFirst a reminder of the known biggest GME shorting losers:\n\n* [Melvin Capital suffered a 49% loss in the 1st-quarter](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/melvin-capital-gamestop-losses-49-first-quarter-decline-reddit-trading-2021-4-1030292729)\n* [Hedge Fund Maplelane lost 45% on Gamestop](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-maplelane-is-clawing-way-back-from-gamestop-losses)\n\nSo what does a massive short GME position look like in 13F filings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME positions from 13F filings for the biggest known losers in GME shorting](https://preview.redd.it/cv9fzhxq6eu61.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=833bc3e0760af8047ed58f5375aaaadac19951a0)\n\nThat's a lot of puts without any GME shares or calls! *Melvin had 6 million shares in puts* and *Maplelane close to 2 million*. Depending on where you look on whalewisdom Maplelane either has no calls or about 500k shares in calls but never any real shares. For now let's assume Maplelane is all in on puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Melvin hasn't held any GME shares since 2015.](https://preview.redd.it/rkj5le8t7eu61.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b4fc0fcdc4c95204e5394846bef3eeedfa71b81)\n\n[Maplelane hasn't held any GME shares since 2014.](https://preview.redd.it/q71rz0hx7eu61.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=75007fcc44dc48023aab5c5b4cd86c0301dda672)\n\nSo big short losers have:\n\n* No shares in GME\n* Large put positions in 13F filings (either exclusively puts or the majority of their position)\n\nWhat do other funds report for their GME positions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All funds with at least 300k in either shares, calls or puts. Short positions are on the left and long positions on the right chart.](https://preview.redd.it/506p312y8eu61.png?width=5350&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c7bad44cb276a92b8d9c87d7765e0327b72806)\n\nHere we see many of the known offenders. A bunch of short funds with majority puts and sometimes a smaller number of call options. Melvin takes the biggest idiot prize with 6 million shares in puts and nothing else. Here are the main offenders based on their end of 2020 filings:\n\n* Melvin capital management lp\n* Susquehanna international group  llp\n* Ubs group ag\n* Group one trading  l.p.\n* Citadel advisors llc\n* Hap trading  llc\n* Citigroup inc\n* Wolverine trading  llc\n* Maplelane capital  llc\n* Jane street group  llc\n\nSome of these market participants operate market making and hedge fund activities. It is difficult to completely separate normal versus abusive practices. That being said these are the likely candidates and a good place for future DD digging.\n\n*Wolverine trading  llc* had an almost identical position to *Maplelane capital  llc* who reported massive losses. *Ubs group ag* is an interesting one with almost 4 million shares in puts and nothing else. Is UBS a final boss?? *Hap trading  llc* & *Citigroup inc* each had almost 2 million shares in puts and not much else. *Group one trading  l.p.*, *Shitadel advisors llc*, *Susquehanna international group  llp* & *Jane street group  llc* feature prominently too.\n\nLet me remind you of the earlier quote:\n\n>Regulation SHO stocks with large, unsettled trades often exhibit a similar characteristic: “short selling” hedge funds with significant put holdings in 13F filings.\n\nMany of these funds exhibit this characteristic and around the end of December and early Jan SI% and FTDs were through the roof. This looks like fuckery.\n\nNext 13F filing updates should arrive by May 17th. This will be big.\n\n**Speculation alert:** Any fund holding predominantly or exclusively a put position is short and likely engaged in illegal married-put naked shorting. The biggest know idiots Melvin and Maplelane have positions that look similar to other large funds (Wolverine, UBS etc.) suggesting we may have a clearer idea of who is up against us. And facing bankruptcy.\n\n# A recap of naked short selling and the married put\n\nThe reason that large put positions in 13F filings is suspicious is because those puts are likely to be the by-product of naked shorting. For a detailed description of how options trading can be used to sell naked shares you can [take a look at this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) and [the follow-up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh6lnz/the_naked_shorting_scam_update_selling_nude_like/). Here is a brief description:\n\n>Being a 'bone-fide' market maker grants you special privileges. One big privilege is to sell shares without needing to fulfil the 'locate' requirement. In other words, 'bone-fide' market makers are allowed to naked short sell, but they must find the shares after a certain amount of time.  \n>  \n>What is a 'bone-fide' market maker? No one really know. The SEC did a shitty job defining it so many brokers can likely pretend they deserve the title.  \n>  \n>How can the 'bone-fide' market maker privileges be abused? Well...  \n>  \n>If a hedge-fund wants to short sell but no shares are available to borrow, or they're too expensive, the hedge-fund can go to their 'bone-fide' market maker friend and follow this simple *'married put'* recipe:  \n>  \n>1 Buy puts from the market maker covering the number of desired shares.  \n>  \n>2 Buy shares from the market maker at the same time. The 'bone-fide' market maker can sell the shares naked as he remains net neutral on the trade.  \n>  \n>3 Make the 'bone-fide' market maker happy by paying a tasty premium for the puts.  \n>  \n>4 Dump the bought shares on the market to suppress prices and remain net short on the puts!  \n>  \n>For an extra spicy recipe that is harder to detect add the following step before step 4:  \n>  \n>3b Sell way way out of the money call options equal to the bought shares that you never expect to be worth anything (800c calls anyone?) to the 'bone-fide' market maker for a small premium. The trade now looks like an innocent [reverse conversion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverseconversion.asp).\n\n# Options fuckery consistent with naked shorting and the married put\n\nSo, if massive naked short selling via the married put trade has been used to cover up FTDs and SI% since Jan we should see some anomalies in the options chain. Let's take a look.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Total open interest for puts & calls as well as FTDs & SI&#37; since Jan 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/is3e6vn3heu61.png?width=4500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ced765a93d48245b0a8b9a6d2394280b42289e5)\n\nHOLY FUCK THATS A MASSIVE JUMP IN OPEN PUT INTEREST!! And it's been sustained since the end of Jan. for the last year open interest in puts and calls remained very similar. At the end of Jan put open interest increased by more than 300% and completely disconnected from call interest. Immediately after this change FTDs and SI% dropped massively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cumulative open interest for puts & calls since Jan 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/cdh81j9yheu61.png?width=3808&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc589f91495376dc303dbbff8cdec756fa62f712)\n\nIf we look at the cumulative open interest over time we see the number of newly opened put contracts has remained steady throughout Feb and into early April. The rate at which these contracts are being bought is far greater than anything seen in 2020.\n\n**Speculation alert:** The huge jump in open put interest could've provided up to 150 MILLION naked short shares to fight the January price spike and hide FTDs and SI%. When combined with certain brokers restricting retail buying, media FUD, January paper hands etc. their ploy appeared quite successful. Since pushing the price back to 40$ in Feb the constant and significant opening of new put contracts has been used to roll over the FTDs and do their best to keep their naked asses covered. Since Jan up to 400 MILLION naked short shares could've been used to hide FTDs and manipulate the price.\n\n# Dark Pool matters\n\nPreviously I speculated that Dark Pools could be used to facilitate the naked shorting trades. This hypothesis can be supported with data by looking at the [OTC data made available by FINRA](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcDownload).\n\nGetting this data was a pain in the ass but I now have all Dark Pool volume data for GME since Nov 2020. This includes [Alternative Trading System (ATS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-trading-system.asp) and [Over-the-Counter (OTC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) volume data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dark Pool trade data for OTC and ATS trade pool.](https://preview.redd.it/ulkgw6e0qhu61.png?width=3076&format=png&auto=webp&s=6447fbe7e5e730f9d90d0525d7db539fff3f4b97)\n\nDark Pool activity ramped up massively at the start of Jan, particularly in the OTC pool. Towards the end of Jan as prices spiked during the mini-squeeze the total number of trades more than quadrupled and the average trade size dropped to around 50 shares per trade, remaining there ever since.\n\nRe-routing of order flow anyone? Short ladder attacks in small share batches anyone?\n\nIf OTC trading was being used to suppress retail buy pressure we'd probably expect to find the worst of all the brokers \\**Robinhood*\\* involved in the trading pool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Total shares trades by firm for OTC and ATS pools since Jan. Note: using Log10 scale for comparison. Citadel actually traded 400M shares OTC!!!](https://preview.redd.it/83iw1c15rhu61.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7db9804c36d863a17be7d7bc8d0ce9f6a1c1586)\n\nWell what a surprise. Citadel trading 400M dark pool shares. Robinhood trading 2 million shares on OTC. The average trade size was ≈1 share which is fucking weird. Interactive Brokers only traded 9559 shares OTC but they made 9559 trades. Exactly 1 share per trade. Fucking weird.\n\nLooking at the OTC market participant names, does anything look familiar? Oh yeah! Some of our market participants with massive puts in 13F filings also love to trade OTC!!\n\n* CITADEL SECURITIES LLC\n* JANE STREET CAPITAL, LLC\n* UBS SECURITIES LLC\n* WOLVERINE SECURITIES, LLC,\n\nAnd the [worst offenders for Robinhood payment for order flow (PFOF)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/):\n\n* CITADEL SECURITIES LLC\n* VIRTU AMERICAS LLC\n* G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, LLC\n* JANE STREET CAPITAL, LLC\n* TWO SIGMA SECURITIES, LLC\n\nTWO SIGMA SECURITIES, LLC is an interesting one. As well as benefiting from PFOF they are also a known short. They don't show up in the 13F filings but they were [reported to take a big hit from short positions in Gamestop](https://www.ft.com/content/1ed2b0de-ea10-4a50-8f33-9f0a1cd38be9).\n\nCOMHAR CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC is a Chicago based firm just minutes away from Citadel. What are they doing trading 14 million GME shares OTC?!? I'm calling bullshit and suggesting this firm can be added to the short fund list.\n\nCOWEN AND COMPANY have 100k shares in puts from 13F but didn't show up in the earlier list as I set a minimum of 300k shares to be included. Another short hedge.\n\nLEK SECURITIES CORPORATION don't have any obvious short positions in GME or news reports of losses. However they were [slapped by the SEC for large scale market manipulation in the recent past](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-obtains-final-judgments-against-200100044.html).\n\n**Edit 1**: G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, LLC is actually owned by [Susquehanna International Group](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk02CdiMwg65ehzWH2qt2q3fRl_b4Jw:1619079033994&q=Susquehanna+International+Group&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEwzMDQ3ys1KVuLSz9U3MCrMMUjL0TLIKLfST87PyUlNLsnMz9PPL0pPzMusSgRxiq0KEotS80oUkAUXscoHlxYXlqZmJOblJSp45pWkFuWBZRJzFNyL8ksLdrAyAgBfDMKMdAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYury1s5HwAhUF2aQKHZzNDa4QmxMoATAWegQIDxAD), one of the funds with tons of puts in 13Fs.\n\n**Edit 2**: Some helpful comments point out that there can be some confusion with market makers and hedge-funds. Citadel is often referred to on this sub as the firm with the most to lose in GME. They operate market making and hedge fund activities. So do a number of other firms (Wolverine, Jane Street etc.). *For naked shorting the participation of 'bone-fide' market makers is crucial*. This is how they can abuse the locate rule and naked short. None of this contradicts the data in this post or the conclusions but it remains difficult to completely separate normal market making activities from abusive ones.\n\n**Speculation alert:** OTC trades have seen massive volume and order size changes since early January. Many of the participants are known short funds. Changes in OTC trading align with evidence of manipulative naked short selling (Deep ITM calls and married-puts). OTC trading has been used to create millions of naked short shares and reroute retail orders to suppress buying pressure.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nHedgies are fucked. Just look at the amount of effort they've had to put into keeping a lid on this thing!!! *When they lose control of the FTDs they lose control of the price*. Millions of illegal naked short shares created in a desperate effort to make retail go away. But guess what??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zz5eu179biu61.gif\n\n**Speculation alert:** Here are my thoughts for what's happened with GME in 2021:\n\n* FTDs and SI% were getting out of control in early Jan\n* As prices increased and more hype came to GME the shorts got more and more desperate\n* Dark Pool OTC volumes went through the roof and Deep ITM call volumes were used to create naked shares ahead of the end of Jan price spike\n* When prices really started to move from Jan 25th - 29th more than 100 million shares were created with Deep ITM call and married-put naked shorting and used to hammer down price and hide SI%\n* A coordinated blocking of buy orders on key retail brokers and media induced FUD helped the shorts knock down the price and scare off some of the FOMO paper hand gang.\n* [Something happened to the short share borrow fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mma7eh/analysis_deep_dive_looking_at_historical_si_ftd/) that completely disconnect from normal pricing.\n* From Feb onwards average trade size on OTC decreased to around 50 shares per trade. That's a 70%+ drop in trade size. Retail orders were funnelled through Dark Pools to control buying pressure and 'short ladder attacks' used to control price.\n* ETFs were used to hide more and more FTDs from the apes. I have data on ETFs but its such a pain to analyse (70+ funds, all different GME allocations, rebalancing over time etc..).\n* DFV doubled down. RC tweeted an ice-cream cone. Deep ITM calls increased. FTDs remerged and on Feb 25th prices started flying again.\n* All this time FTDs and prices have been manipulated with tricky options trades. Up to 200 million naked short shares could've been made from Feb through to April 6th using married put trades.\n* But the apes are still here. Millions of short fund options have expired. FTDs are shown to get uncontrollable over time. An unprecedented FTD squeeze will come. New DTCC rules, a stronger SEC, GME annual meeting and share recall. So many catalysts. Shorts are fucked.\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

        "selftext": "Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. (This is a re-post, if you previously saw this I would appreciate an upvote for visibility. The previous post got a lot of traction but was removed a mod. I spoke to a mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve a re-post.)\n\nTLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, using an illegal method/loophole to \"cover\" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options. Full version below.\n\nThere’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.\n\nThe first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nPlummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nThe second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nThe way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.\n\nThe tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.\n\nThe SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\n\nThe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:\n\n* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.\n* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.\n* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.\n* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.\n* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.\n* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.\n\nIt gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.\n\nBelow is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:\n\n***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**\n\n\\*\\*\n\nIn short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.\n\nThese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.\n\nIf this is true, and as explained there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes \"its only a loss when you sell.\" The version for shorts would be \"its only a loss if you close out your short positions.\"\n\nAnother factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)\n\nIn addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.\n\nI would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.\n\nIn considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.\n\n**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)\n\n**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)\n\nSidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the \"new\" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.\n\nIf you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.\n\nThere's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can stay \"retarded\" longer than funds can stay solvent. The \"paper hand\" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)\n\nAt least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:\n\n* **\"Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.\"** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.\n* **\"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.\"** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks ([read this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/), which also supports the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.\n* **\"If his forces are united, separate them\"** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving \"weak-hands\" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some \"paper hands\", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.\n\nI will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further.

They closed Apogee (regulated dark pool) and remained a Market Maker (MM) to forego Investment Banking and Prime Broker restrictions. \n* It choked out the competition with purchases of competing MM assets, and by securing key roles at the most powerful exchanges (DMM at NYSE, largest MM at Nasdaq, CBOE).  It even chartered its own exchange, MEMX, in a bid to lower trade and data costs while strengthening PFOF capabilities.\n* This led to Citadel being a securities “wholesaler”, having enough supply or access to meet any order.\n* *This* allowed them to become the US’s largest internalizer and conduct exchange activities inside its own walls.\n* They offer access to their “liquidity” via Citadel Connect, which has grown to become one of, if not the, largest dark pool – without ever being classified as such.  It leverages Citadel’s massive wholesaler inventory and extensive supply reach but without requiring exchange features or oversights.\n* Citadel also captured 35%-45%+ share of retail orders through Payment For Order Flow (PFOF), a practice which avoids competition while providing leverage over dependent brokers.\n\n > “[Ken Griffin has] built an extraordinarily diverse organization… something with franchise value.”\n > – [Institutional Investor, 2001](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b15134ls4fblx7/boy-wonder)\n\n* “Franchise value” means it is **replicable**.

Citadel has Market Making access or internalizing responsibilities in nearly all of the world’s wealth centers across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, as well as North America.  They are likely the world’s largest MM and internalizer, either by unit volume, $ volume, or revenue. \n* Further, Citadel’s size, position, and competencies make them a material competitor to almost any player in the financial world.  Even major, multinational Investment Banks and Prime Brokers consider them a serious threat.  \n  \n**In short, Citadel has positioned itself at the heart of markets worldwide.

They don’t have a problem.\n* The biggest Prime Brokerages are the “big boy” brokerages.  They have huge balance sheets that can absorb the riskiest, most complex positions from the largest hedge funds (*cough, Archegos, cough*).\n* Because they’re so big and so good at managing risk (hah...), they also offer customized “exotic financial vehicles” which have other features.\n * Exotic products like: SWAPS (which hides client positions), DARK POOLS (taking positions in securities without affecting their price), CUSTOM BUNDLES (“tranches” of MBS, for example), and so on.\n * (*Tell me where the “SWAPS” tab is on your eTrade account when you’re done napping at that bus stop*)\n* The hedge funds you read about **actually don’t own a single security** – they have a contract with the Prime Broker who holds and does all the transactions on their behalf.\n* And Prime Brokers have Dave-Lauer-type smart people working for their assets, representing them in the marketplace (i.e. **street cred**).\n* All this for a price.\n\nIn short, a Prime Broker is a big, impressive bank that offers custom flavors of investment products.  They’re the “big boy club”, able to handle larger transactions that specialized firms can’t do themselves.\n\n*  It’s how “Real Money” invests – hedge funds, giant pension funds, etc.  Everyone else eats at the kid table.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*But what about Investment Banks?*\n\n\n \nIf Prime Brokers serve people, then Investment Banks serve **companies**. \n\n* Since you’re really good at pretending you have a job when your parents ask, how about you pretend you run a large company.\n * Rather than try and sell your inkjet-printed “stock certificates,” you go to an Investment Bank, who promises you actual money in exchange for your non-imaginary stock offering.\n * They handle all aspects of the issuance, regulatory, collateral, and technical process of raising funds, taking on debt, whatever your company needs – and they make their money with the difference between what they deliver you and what they receive from the market.\n *  (They handle these deals because of their market relationships and their familiarity with the exchanges and trading framework.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Gotcha.  Investment Banks for companies and Prime Brokers for people.  So why do we care about these prime brokers that are investment banks?*\n\nWow this is a lot of questions from someone missing so many teeth.\n\n* Like all of finance, it’s made-up bullshit.  Which Ken Griffin cares about.\n* The biggest Prime Brokerage Investment Banks are the hubs of the investing infrastructure, and as such, they are regulated more than others.\n* They are called “Systemically Important Financial Institutions” (SIFI) – that’s an official term – and ***these are the real big boys.***\n* There are only a handful of them. They don’t fuck around.\n * Ha ha, okay, they do, but in a waaaay different league than you.\n* They are the biggest banks you've heard of – they even extend their services to countries and international trade organizations.   Some are responsible for various aspects of US bonds, for example.\n* Entire economies, even the world economy, relies on each of them to a degree.\n\nIn other words, **Real Money** clients come to them for **Real Money** needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSifipbibs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n#4.4 Crusades\n\n**Suddenly,** you are magically placed back at Citadel’s trading desk – all their tools at your disposal.  *What do?*\n\n* Your goal is to minimize risk better than these competitors can, specifically in securities.\n* (Fortunately, Citadel enjoys some specialized tools that not even they have…)\n\nAnd by the way, do you know what the opposite of risk is?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>!**Control.**!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>!So your goal is: *to control the price of securities.*  That’s right: ***control the price of securities.***!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou start looking around and seeing, well, regulation is slow and lax.

Maybe... maybe they made mistakes, or had some bad actors that they fired...*\n \n* Well, champ, too bad the data does NOT support your presumption of innocence:\n\n * Citadel had 15 different “regulatory events” for 2021… or roughly 2% of all of FINRA regulatory events (based on estimated 800 events).  That number is *high*.\n * Some of those were redundant though: Citadel’s most recent regulation event was a price-affecting activity that went on **over 6 years with14 different exchanges**\n * They were also fined for misreporting internal trades – oh yeah u/atobitt [wrote about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml48ov/walkin_like_a_duck_talkin_like_a_duck/)\n* And this number only reflects the crimes Citadel was *caught* for.  (Relevant: FINRA seems to be [less and less effective these days](https://www.finra.org/media-center/statistics#key))\n\nIllegal activities are widespread.  It could even be said it’s the “Industry standard.”\n\n* Citadel Securities reported $7bn profits for 2021 (btw, this number is [self-reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/citadel-securities-opens-up-after-record-7-billion-windfall))\n* It paid a maximum $3.04m in [fines](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/116797), total, for 15 “regulation events” ($3m is extremely conservative – high – because Citadel doesn’t report its annual fines so I added up all dollar amounts for 2021, lol.  It’s probably far less but I wanted to max out the number)\n* **Thats a 0.0434% “crime tax” – part of the cost of doing unlawful and illegal business.**\n * (0.0% if we’re rounding)\n* (Notably, some fines were for illicit activities from *years* ago.  This year’s illegal activities won’t be “crime taxed” for a few years down the road.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, seriously, why should Citadel worry about laws?\n\n* (...and if they don’t need to worry about laws, why should you presume they keep them?)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n***(...back at the desk...)***\n\n\n\nNo, really.  Why should you worry about laws?\n\n* Remember [this?](https://i.redd.it/iuxh7unu2nb71.gif)\n * This is less than one hundredth of a second, for a single ticker (AMZN), slowed down.\n * Citadel moves at this speed *for every ticker, in every asset, in every country, in every time zone it operates in, while trading* ***at industrial volumes.***\n* Now remember [this interview,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0Sj6Us19I) where Gary Gensler said the SEC can’t afford coffee? (wow there is a suspicious lack of google results for this, btw)\n * Let’s take the SEC’s posture at face value.\n * The SEC (FINRA by proxy) issued 73 fines to Citadel, but over *years* of transactions.  How many transactions do you think occurred versus those the SEC examined by a human?  What percentage of Citadel’s trades were affected by a human regulator?\n* To be cynical – do you think that Gary “can’t buy coffee” Gensler and the SEC can afford to keep up with Citadel’s nanosecond industrial volumes of trades?  For every ticker?  Every exchange, ATS, SDP, and broker they interface with? Let alone Citadel’s *international* operations?  Over *years*?\n* (Each new flavor of high-frequency fuckery will be baked in to trading algorithms, all while either observing regulations or “unintentionally circumventing proper reporting”)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd so, we arrive at a cold reality:\n\n>!**Citadel and other MMs likely operate outside of the law** because they operate in “bullet time”, while the regulators operate in “past tense”!<\n\n>!**Citadel’s trading speed and volume effectively exceed the limit and capacity of regulation.**!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(This, of course, is taking the SEC’s – at large – posture at face value)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n0.0% crime tax, dude.\n\n***\n\n#4.6 A Royal Union\n\n*But… but – what about other players?  They are competing with Citadel across the board!  Competition keeps Citadel in check, right?*\n  \n* As referenced in previous posts: Citadel’s dominance discourages new challengers – [the industry is consolidating.](https://i.redd.it/1ze9zs5sin491.png)\n * While Virtu (Citadel’s main MM competitor) and other larger firms might “micro-grapple” in the HFT space, the losses would only represent a small cost in a profitable business.\n* Weak enforcement, plus Citadel’s dominance, incentivizes the opposite of competition: ***collaboration.***\n\n*Collaboration?! But how could the firms work together?  It’s broad daylight – public data!  And it’s illegal to collude!*\n\n* It’s illegal to get caught, Timmy.  \n* The small group of market makers have all the ingredients to not only *outpace* the regulators, but can *avoid detection altogether*:\n * extremely fast technology, exclusive knowledge of complicated systems, brilliantly talented “quants”...\n * …and the reward is essentially risk-free profits, so…\n\n“Hypothetically”\n\n* If several market makers wanted to collaborate and minimize risk (i.e. **price fixing**) in a given security…\n * …they would need to send and receive patterns which act as hidden signals in plain view (*check check*)\n * …and they would need a mutual understanding of techniques, as well as a common goal: shared profits (*check check*)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n[*No, please don’t say it.*](https://c.tenor.com/sSwRqdgMyQMAAAAC/impossible-star-wars.gif)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n>![Apes have noticed patterns in the bids for *years*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/po51aw/we_just_had_3_separate_orders_for_300_shares_per/)!<  \n\n>![Oh, you want evidence to show that prices are being signaled?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/phks3c/fast_forward_to_about_58_minutes_possible_codes/) and [buy/sell prices are being coordinated?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pul5gq/divorced_from_reality_dd/) !<\n  \n>![How about a site that compiles these signals on a daily basis?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u7iox3/it_is_time_to_talk_about_market_maker_signals_i/)!<\n\n>![*code sheet*](https://i.redd.it/83m462308fl71.png)!<\n\n&nbsp;  \n  \n[WHAT IN THE DUMP TRUCK FUCK.](https://c.tenor.com/b2BSVm38AUgAAAAC/blink-blinking.gif)\n  \n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n#4.7 All the Sun Touches, I\n\nSo, we arrive at the crazy conclusion, the one that’s obvious.\n\nBecause between their market position and marketplace incentives, joint activities, and an environment with weak enforcement, we can start to put together a scenario where…\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>!**Citadel likely has a claim on controlling the prices of securities**!<\n\n>!...a legitimate claim, in conjunction with other market makers, exchanges, and key parties.!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* FYI, “Price control” doesn’t need to be 100% of securities 100% of the time.\n* If Citadel can be the “margin of victory”, just in the securities they care about, then that’s the difference between a successful trade and an unsuccessful one – decisive direction.\n * (Note that Casinos operate profitably with 51%+ odds.) [(relevant)](https://i.redd.it/fsny6euskn491.gif)\n* The dominance of the top MM’s also means there are no alternatives – it’s either price arranging via Citadel, or the naked uncertainty of the market (and oh, yeah, we just said it’s not so uncertain, didn’t we?)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBecause, after all, your goal is to control the price of securities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n#4.8 The Round Table\n\nNow, think on this for a second.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you influence prices, you could make a KILLING by renting it out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> >!I can’t find where I read it now, but evidently Citadel rents out co-location space in its servers.!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>!Turns out, SELLING PRICE CONTROL as a service (directly or indirectly) – and being an EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER – is a great way to profit!!<\n\n* No brainer – it is almost always profitable to work with the firm that controls prices.\n* As an added benefit: any firm positioned against Citadel should also expect to be competing with *all of Citadel's aligned parties* (i.e. **street cred**).\n* **Citadel won’t ever advertise this, because publicity is a risk to illegal activities.**\n * But there will be signs:\n\n > “Citadel Securities made [...] $**4.1m** per [employee] in 2020.

        "selftext": "Hey Melbournians!I am a fraud analyst at a bank and because it is my job to get yelled at by customers who have been scammed here are somethings I think everyone should know about how to keep your cards safe and to keep you from talking to me, or blaming me for losing money.\n\n1. Don't buy Peter Alexander pyjamas advertised on social media, in fact put down the Facebook and Instagram adds all together! They are a fast way at having your card compromised.  This is called a goods and service scam and Meta is terrible at regulating their adds. If you see a nice deal online, check the merchants official webpage that the deals match.\n2. Your card may be scammed anyway. Sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Scammers have card generators and other ways of testing cards, if there is no discernible way of telling how the card was compromised, we may never know and it may not be your fault at all. Every person with a bank card is at risk. I know losing money can be scary but try and be patient and wait for the bank to finish the investigation. We need to confirm with the merchant the transactions were fraud, that saves companies from losing money to fake fraud claims.\n3. Always read messages with OTP (one time passwords) to approve transactions, or even to verify yourself over the phone. If a scammer is trying to get you to disclose a OTP for password reset or to approve the transaction the code will always say what it is for. Only repeat codes over the phone that say \"this is for the purpose of verifying your identity. If you do disclose a code, you might have to kiss your money goodbye because that is now your fault. I hate when customers have been tricked into disclosing these codes but we all also have a responsibility to use caution when taking inbound calls from banks or companies. If you are ever concerned, hang up and call the company directly. A real company will never argue about your concerns for security.\n4. Toll roads and Auspost are not messaging you to get you to update details, never disclose any personal information to a link from a text message.\n5. Never download any screen sharing apps to someone calling you from any company. \"Hi I've noticed your internet speed is slow, please download any desk and I will help you.\" This is called a remote access scam and you will not get your money back if they manage to get into your accounts.\n6. The banks may block some of your genuine transactions. It may annoy you when you're trying to buy something you really want or need. Please remember the fraud and scam side of the bank are not the people raising your interest rates and \"stealing\" your money, we are just trying to protect your accounts and if we need to use a little extra security that's okay! It may have inconvenienced you but I guarantee the same system has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars from leaving your fellow Australian's bank accounts. So be thankful the bank was trying to do the right thing for once.\n7. Check ATM's for external devices and anything that may be added to the outside of the machine. This is one of the largest scams on Australian soil (yes Australians can be scammers too) and it's called card skimming. This is when a device is added to an ATM to read the magnetic strip of a card, a replica card is made with the magnetic strip. Banks have ways to detect if a magnetic strip was used. Can you remember the last time you swiped your card for a transaction? Magnetic strip transactions may get blocked by the bank.\n8. If your card is compromised, we will have to reissue it. I'm sorry, I know it is inconvenient but what is worse? Setting up direct debits again and getting a new card or getting scammed thousands of dollars? I lived for 5 years with only a cash card, you can live a few days on cash, and hopefully you wont have a melt down on the phone to me about it.\n9. Fake QR codes can be placed on parking meters and it can drain your account. Don't pay for parking where a QR code is accepted. You may even approve a $5000 transaction by providing a OTP to the fake parking website thinking your approving your parking. Don't do it.\n10. At the end of the day there is no way to keep your accounts 100% secure but there are ways to help protect your security. Always use caution! How many customers I hear say \"I'm normally really good with this kind of stuff. I don't know why I didn't double check.\" Everyone thinks they're scam proof until they aren't. Be smart, be safe and always google \"(company name) scams\" and see what it comes up with.\n\nThese are my 10 tips and tricks for protecting your account. I hope I help at least one Melbournian from getting scammed today. Have you ever been scammed? Or know of any scams I didn't mention? Send me a comment or a message, I'm always interested in learning new ways to help people not get scammed.  \n\n\n  \nEdits: Here are some notable mentions from the comments and answers to some common questions.   \n\n\n\\- [Booking](https://Bookings.com).com scam, after making a booking through the website, an email – sent from [noreply@booking.com](mailto:noreply@booking.com) – claims their stay may have to be cancelled unless they hand over their bank card details via an embedded link. This is a scam and there's information online about it. Stay safe holidaiers. \n\n\\- Gift card scams, double check if you receive an email from your boss or your neighbour asking you to buy gift cards. Their email may have been hacked. This also extends to companies asking for payment in gift cards. \n\n\\- Banks/security agencies will never ask you to transfer any of your funds out to a \"secure account\". We will just block your accounts and kick everyone out and then give you access again once it is safe. NEVER transfer funds to a random account that isn't yours. \n\n\\- Yes card skimmers are used in Australia, google it and check the news. Lots of information.   \n\n\n\\- Unless the transactions are really regular, we believe you. We believe the transactions were not you, you don't have to try and convince me, that makes me more sceptical.  \n\n\\- Sometimes banks actually call you, sometimes we text you. If you get a message or email from anyone with your name and last four digits of your card number, please call your bank anyway. That's a security concern that shouldn't be overlooked and that's how you get compromised so just call us anyway. Don't go on to me about how you thought it was a scam.   \n\n\n\\- Card generators or (BIN ATTCKS) are still common. Fraudsters use brute force and software to \"guess\" and generate the card numbers. If you're interested in how it works, or you don't think it's possible, you can google it. \n\n\\- There's a difference between fraud and scams which I did not highlight well in my original post. A scam is where someone has scammed you into giving up information, card details, passwords and security codes. Fraud is where someone uses brute force or other means to access your accounts or cards. \n\n\\- If you have any of your ID compromised, please visit [www.idcare.org](https://www.idcare.org) (or google it yourself lol at me including links) and you can find information on scam and fraud trends at [scamwatch.gov.au](https://scamwatch.gov.au) but they are not always up to date on the trends so if a scam isn't on there, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.   \n\n\nOkay this post is getting longer so if you need me I'll be in the comments.
