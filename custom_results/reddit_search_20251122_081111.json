Not every choice lands as well as it could have, but overall, the experience is certainly worth playing, especially in co-op.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Brendan Frye](https://opencritic.com/critic/400/brendan-frye) - [7 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc/)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 offers predictable but fun multiplayer, interesting additions to its zombies mode, but a single-player/co-op campaign that's tedious and too goofy by far.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Trevor Houston](https://opencritic.com/critic/809/trevor-houston) - [90 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/)\n\n>Treyarch has crafted something special: a sprawling, ambitious, and endlessly replayable shooter that caters to nearly every corner of the Call of Duty fandom. It’s not flawless, and some may scoff at the lack of innovation, but it stands as a staggering achievement in both scale and ambition. Massive and occasionally messy, it’s nonetheless a thrilling ride. Black Ops 7 delivers everything fans could hope for and then some.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digital Chumps](https://opencritic.com/outlet/96/digital-chumps)** - [Ben Sheene](https://opencritic.com/critic/5312/ben-sheene) - [9 / 10](https://digitalchumps.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 presents a gargantuan amount of content meant to satisfy players of all stripes. While the story can't rival last year's roller coaster, Treyarch's masterclass gunplay stretches across numerous modes with unified progression.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Jeremy Peel](https://opencritic.com/critic/747/jeremy-peel) - [3 / 5](https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review)\n\n>A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [Unscored](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-boss-giganti-armi-rare-co-op-campagna-non-stessa-66401.html)\n\n>We're not yet ready to give a definitive verdict on the game, which will arrive very soon (with a score attached), but we've already begun exploring the shooter's other components, and it's immediately clear that this campaign lacks quality even from the less successful entries in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Olaf Bleich](https://opencritic.com/critic/7459/olaf-bleich) - *German* - [70%](https://www.games.ch/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/test/review-mAjh/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Dalton Cooper](https://opencritic.com/critic/260/dalton-cooper) - [8 / 10](https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's robust Multiplayer and Zombies offerings make up for the weaknesses of its co-op campaign.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Tobias Veltin](https://opencritic.com/critic/3623/tobias-veltin) - *German* - [Unscored](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/cod-black-ops-7-kampagne-test,3442954.html)\n\n>Whether you're interested in it is, of course, entirely up to you. For me, the Black Ops 7 campaign ultimately falls somewhere between the story modes of the last two years. Significantly better than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, but also considerably below Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [S.E. Doster](https://opencritic.com/critic/7897/s-e-doster) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The latest entry in the Call of Duty series gives players more ways to play the campaign than ever, to various degrees of success.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Age](https://opencritic.com/outlet/868/gaming-age)** - [Austen Canupp](https://opencritic.com/critic/10239/austen-canupp) - [8.5 / 10](https://gaming-age.com/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review-for-pc-playstation-xbox/)\n\n>Overall, the campaign and endgame content in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is another great addition to the franchise’s lineup, and, while it was slightly lacking in some aspects with the storytelling itself, the set design and experience of the whole campaign more than made up for it. Do yourself a favor and turn off social media for a day while you play, to avoid letting people get in your head about why you shouldn’t like it, and just give it a fair shot. If you like Black Ops, you will like this.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [David Burdette](https://opencritic.com/critic/7590/david-burdette) - [100 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-the-best-call-of-duty-in-the-modern-era/)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is an incredible feat by all teams involved. There has not been a Call of Duty game yet that has the scope of Black Ops 7, or the interconnected social experience it provides. Every facet of the game, whether Zombies, Multiplayer, Endgame, Dead Ops Arcade 4, or campaign, feels like it was crafted passionately. Outstanding gameplay and progression systems back up a packed title; I’ll be playing BO7 for a very long time. Black Ops 7 is the pinnacle of modern Call of Duty, blending the past with the present in a way that’s worthy of the grind you’ll be putting into it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Simon Cardy](https://opencritic.com/critic/5521/simon-cardy) - [6 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign is a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Alessandro Digioia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8524/alessandro-digioia) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://it.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/221996/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-la-recensione)\n\n>The biggest Black Ops ever: packed with content and fun, but with a weak campaign and a few aspects that need refinement.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris), [Győző Baki](https://opencritic.com/critic/7625/gy-z-baki) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2025/11/14/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-complete-review/)\n\n>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is an absolute riot. It's not afraid to rely on copious amounts of nostalgia, while also pushing the series forward in the most logical direction. Treyarch have looked back at Black Ops 2 and 3 for inspiration, and have delivered a fantastic Call of Duty, full to the brim of incredible content.\n\n-------------"
