        "original_text": "## The Man\n\nDestiny is a controversial streamer who started with Starcraft back in the early days but has transitioned into debate content usually around his Neoliberal or Pro-Israel views.\n\nHe was banned from Twitch for transphobic speech (he uses a lot of \"gamer words\") and now streams on Kick.\n\nHe has been accused of being a sex pest numerous times, even going back to the beginning of his career. He's currently in two different legal battles, one for sharing revenge porn on Discord, and a second accusing him of grooming an underage girl. He has admitted to keeping CSAM of her on his computer for legal purposes.\n\nHe and his community were a large driver of the most recent \"Collargate\" drama with Hasan Piker, who is one of his archnemeses.\n\n## The Tour\n\nDestiny is very involved with various Liberal PACs and is currently headlining the cross-country [\"Unfuck America Tour\"](https://www.unfuckamericatour.com/) with other like-minded commentators who are edgy \"no filter\" type Centrist and Neoliberals. It markets itself as the counter to Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA tour, in which he was assassinated last month.\n\n## The Girl\n\n[EmpathChan](https://x.com/Emp4thchan) is a neo-Nazi Onlyfans E-girl who is best known for [posting edgelord things on twitter like selfies with Swastikas](https://i.imgur.com/tznODLV.jpeg) and recording herself on Kick/Rumble committing hate crimes. [There is an 8-minute compilation of her spitting on homeless people and calling them various slurs.](https://rumble.com/v56uerg-of-girl-spits-on-strangers-for-money.html) (Warning: Disturbing video)\n\nEmpathChan posts a selfie from Destiny's apartment and it's found that she's been staying with him during the tour. Many people theorized they are dating or sleeping with each other.\n\nDestiny says he's asked her to \"chill\" and that he's not having a romantic relationship with her. [He bans anybody who suggests this and says they should kill themselves](https://i.imgur.com/Yv3vP7c.png).\n\nShe later posts a weird racial insult about Destiny's teenage son on Twitter.\n\n## The Post\n\nAn incident happened at the most recent tour stop where EmpathChan is on video calling Darius, a bi-racial ride-or-die Destiny orbiter best known for getting into physical fights with people, the F----t and N----r slurs (hard R), All while she is decked out in \"Unfuck America\" merch.\n\nAttempting to post this to Livestreamfail, the subreddit Destiny and his community run, will get deleted and you banned but it is posted as a \"Honeypot Thead\" and stickied to his personal subreddit. (Meaning anybody who comments in it gets banned): [DramaEmpathchan called Darius the F and N slurs.

Any normal person would refuse to communicate with a person who records themselves doing hate crimes.\n> \n> I've only known about Destiny for 2 months now, but I can't trust this dude's judgement anymore.

Now before I get nuked from orbit, let me say that I don't know if he invited her, at the same time, shit like this should be met with an immediate \"What the actual fuck is wrong with you, don't do that and don't come here\". And if that's not immediate, at least after you figure out what happened and have the details, you ought tell this person not to come to these events. Then if they show up, out of your hands.

Idrc what tiny does in his personal life but if he wants to be taken seriously in the political world he has to keep these interactions away from that. Like if we’re being honest I believe pretty easily and it’s not fair but Destiny’s personal and relationship drama has hurt his career more than joking about Charlie Kirk. When I try to introduce my friends to him the first things they say is “isn’t that guy a cuck”or “didn’t he fly out a 17 year old”. It’s not true or fair but that’s what a lot of people think of when you bring up Destiny, these aren’t even “political” people. I don’t want to sound like an anti-fan. Steven has done a lot, in a lot of ways was one of the only big center left figures holding the line in the social media space. I think it’s important however we seriously start trying to support and build up other bigger center left personalities like Adam Mockler because realistically I think they will be the ones unfortunately not Destiny to really bring more people to our side.\n\n---\n\n### Some aren't phased and still appreciate him\n\n> [Aba was right about Destiny.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nl0rrgj/) There is no reason to take his political intentions seriously when he consistently does dumb shit to ruin his own image.\n> \n> > I take his political intentions seriously. He puts in a ton of work and I really appreciate him doing these events as well as the canvassing and other efforts.

The bonus is she is also willing to commit hate crimes on me and my family in public because of our skin colour.\n> \n> So yes, I do think that.\n> \n> > If you genuinely think that I can't help you. Fuentes and myron have huge followings that they are radicalizing to do much worse and vote for people that have done and will do immeasurable damage to this country and the world.

        "translated_text": "## The Man\n\nDestiny is a controversial streamer who started with Starcraft back in the early days but has transitioned into debate content usually around his Neoliberal or Pro-Israel views.\n\nHe was banned from Twitch for transphobic speech (he uses a lot of \"gamer words\") and now streams on Kick.\n\nHe has been accused of being a sex pest numerous times, even going back to the beginning of his career. He's currently in two different legal battles, one for sharing revenge porn on Discord, and a second accusing him of grooming an underage girl. He has admitted to keeping CSAM of her on his computer for legal purposes.\n\nHe and his community were a large driver of the most recent \"Collargate\" drama with Hasan Piker, who is one of his archnemeses.\n\n## The Tour\n\nDestiny is very involved with various Liberal PACs and is currently headlining the cross-country [\"Unfuck America Tour\"](https://www.unfuckamericatour.com/) with other like-minded commentators who are edgy \"no filter\" type Centrist and Neoliberals. It markets itself as the counter to Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA tour, in which he was assassinated last month.\n\n## The Girl\n\n[EmpathChan](https://x.com/Emp4thchan) is a neo-Nazi Onlyfans E-girl who is best known for [posting edgelord things on twitter like selfies with Swastikas](https://i.imgur.com/tznODLV.jpeg) and recording herself on Kick/Rumble committing hate crimes. [There is an 8-minute compilation of her spitting on homeless people and calling them various slurs.](https://rumble.com/v56uerg-of-girl-spits-on-strangers-for-money.html) (Warning: Disturbing video)\n\nEmpathChan posts a selfie from Destiny's apartment and it's found that she's been staying with him during the tour. Many people theorized they are dating or sleeping with each other.\n\nDestiny says he's asked her to \"chill\" and that he's not having a romantic relationship with her. [He bans anybody who suggests this and says they should kill themselves](https://i.imgur.com/Yv3vP7c.png).\n\nShe later posts a weird racial insult about Destiny's teenage son on Twitter.\n\n## The Post\n\nAn incident happened at the most recent tour stop where EmpathChan is on video calling Darius, a bi-racial ride-or-die Destiny orbiter best known for getting into physical fights with people, the F----t and N----r slurs (hard R), All while she is decked out in \"Unfuck America\" merch.\n\nAttempting to post this to Livestreamfail, the subreddit Destiny and his community run, will get deleted and you banned but it is posted as a \"Honeypot Thead\" and stickied to his personal subreddit.

        "original_text": "**I am NOT OOP, OOP is** u/Ok-Disaster-1788\n\n**Originally posted to r/AITAH**\n\n**AITAH for telling my MIL that she \"made her choice\" when she chose to keep seeing my husband's ex?**\n\n*Editor’s note: added paragraph breaks for ease of readability*\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** >!verbal abuse, emotional manipulation, mentions of racism!<\n\n-----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/OE57yTuHcs): **May 17, 2025**\n\nI (33F) and my husband Tom (35M) have been NC with most of his family for three years. Within those three years, I've had twin boys, which has made my MIL try to get back in contact with me. There's a lot of history, but here's a brief summary of why Tom and I are NC, and it all revolves around Tom's ex, who we'll call Talia.\n\nSo, I am Indian American, and Tom is white. He comes from a pretty traditional family, and grew up in a \"small town\". Talia was MIL's best friend's daughter, and they were the small town romance everybody envied. \n\nHowever, upon meeting in college, Tom and I just clicked on a platonic level, and to be honest, I didn't even have feelings for Tom until four dates in. I guess you could say he had an \"emotional affair\", but he never did anything physically romantic until he broke up with Talia. Talia, of course, remained in contact with his family since she had been (according to MIL) \"the daughter she always wanted\". \n\nKeep in mind, Tom HAS A SISTER! But, Talia is more of a homemaker, while my SIL (who is an absolute ANGEL) and I had always been more career focused. Talia had been at every holiday, family gathering, and get together since the very start of the relationship, and at first I paid it no mind. I was civil to Talia because MIL made it clear Talia mattered to her, despite Talia's blatant distaste and disrespectful attitude towards me. That changed at my weddings.\n\nWe had two, and my parents footed the bill for both. The dress code was simple, aside from the obvious no white/wedding party colors rule, NOBODY was supposed to wear red. I am well aware that red means you slept with the groom, but more importantly, RED IS A BRIDAL COLOR IN MY CULTURE! I wore a red lehenga and saree to my Indian wedding, which she wore an \"eggshell\" (off white) dress to (keep in mind, white is worn at funerals to represent purity in my culture). That got my aunties and cousins talking, but I still had a blast since I really didn't care. I DID care when she showed up to the 'American ceremony' in a floor length, apple red gown with a slit going up the leg. It was a bridesmaid's dress, and it violated the dress code. \n\nMy SIL, along with Tom, went to tell her to change. She did leave after having a hushed argument and came back in a tea length green gown (I assume she just wanted to see if she could get away with it). Apparently, my aunties saw this too. Which meant Talia was subjected to stares, whispers, and backhanded giggle fits throughout my whole 'American' wedding. It made Talia feel embarrassed and she cried to MIL, who went to me and told me to \"keep my kind in line\". \n\nTo this, I crossed my arms and told her that maybe Talia should've stayed in her lane, that she knew not to wear red for multiple (but mostly cultural) reasons, and it wasn't my fault my family is shaming her. It isn't my fault she became canon fodder for my gossiping gaggle of a family (yes, I said those words since that is what my aunties are). Those were the consequences of her actions. Tom and SIL backed me up, and MIL left with Talia before dessert.\n\nThe next day there was a social media post from Talia, crying about how she was 'exiled' from her 'best friends' wedding because the bride was jealous. \n\nI made a post back, telling her that she wore red, knowing how inappropriate it was. How her 'best friend' is her ex, and to not sugar coat what she did. I then tagged my MIL in a separate post with screenshots of Talia's post and told her this was the last straw, and that I have been disrespected by Talia from the very beginning of my relationship, and that now that I was her DIL, she needed to keep Talia away from 'family events and holidays' since she doesn't respect my husband and I. I didn't care if they still went on weekly shopping sprees or spa days, just keep her away from Christmas and BBQ's. \n\nTalia removed her post after being publicly called out. MIL was good on this compromise until three years ago, after Talia came to Thanksgiving with a pie and a plastered smile, A THANKSGIVING THAT I WAS HOSTING. She said something along the lines of 'MIL invited me' and 'I wanted to make sure MIL can actually eat something, since I know you tend to cook ethnic food'. I slammed the door in her face, went over to MIL, and told her she could leave with Talia, who I just slammed the door on. \n\nTom looked at his mom, who had this deer in the headlights look. She tried to sputter excuses, and my FIL tried to defend my MIL, but Tom stood firm. He said they had lost access to him, and any extension of him, since they chose Talia. My in-laws (aside from SIL) left, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nFast forward to last week, I got a text from an unknown number, and it was MIL. She said she saw a picture of my boys from a mutual friend's post, and wanted to reconcile. She said she'd keep Talia away this time, and that ever since she got cut off, she's been in minimal contact with Talia anyway (her Facebook begs to differ). I told her as much, saying I knew BS when I smelt it, and \"she made her choice\". \n\nI told Tom about it, and asked if he missed his family. He shrugged, saying he doesn't care, and it's been relieving not having his mom around (he's the youngest son of three, so he was always the 'baby boy'). But, I have since received text from my BILs, their wives, and my FIL begging for a second chance.\n\nShe always wanted to be a grandma, and I do feel like I'm robbing her of a chance. Her other sons haven't had children yet, and SIL cut her off when we did. But, you can't undo nearly a decade of disrespect with wishes and wants. And Talia is still in the picture, so I'm skeptical about how long that promise will last. I feel like I'm being calloused, but there are so many stories I can tell about Talia's disregard for Tom's boundaries, and mine. And I don't want to welcome a storm into my house by opening up the gates.\n\nAITAH for telling my MIL \"she made her choice\" after she kept my husband's ex around?\n\nEDIT: since there seems to be some confusion, I want to clarify Tom did not cheat on Talia with me. Tom broke up with Talia after a few platonic hang outs with me. That is why I said you could call it an 'emotional affair' , because you could argue it was one: loosely. Tom only asked me out after he broke up with Talia, and I accepted after he confirmed via texts (he had broken up with her while visiting home for the weekend). There was no overlap between Talia's relationship and mine with Tom. So, for everyone who thinks I was 'other woman' and 'the reason my MIL hates me if because Tom cheated on Talia', no he didn't.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** INFO: Did you marry your husband or your BILs, their wives and your FIL?\n\nBecause your husband is relieved, but you seem to think you might be the asshole for not taking away that relief? It's just a weird thing to think you are an asshole for not being a bad wife.\n\n> **OOP:** It is mostly due to my overthinking, I just tend to overthink now (which really wasn't a problem before having kids). I once spent twenty minutes in the kitchen debating on if Tom thought my feet smelt post birth. Legit cried, and Tom had to hold me and assure me I didn't stink. It's funny now, but back then I was worried about an oncoming divorce because my toes were gross XD Postpartum hormones were haywire and my confidence never fully recovered\n\n**Commenter 2:** The moment she referred to your family as “your kind” is the moment you should have never spoken to her again. This woman has been outwardly racist towards you & you don’t think that she won’t make your children insecure about their race?\n\n> **OOP:** Tom actually snipped that talk in the bud post wedding, when I told him everything. Told her he would call her out if she ever spoke like that about my family again. I attended every gathering after my wedding, and my SIL and Tom acted as watch dogs. My MIL did attempt to \"joke\" about 'smelly Indians' at a Church potluck (I had brought butter chicken since I knew it was easier for their palettes). Tom said something like \"My wife smells great, can't say the same about you. No amount of perfume can get rid of all those cigarettes\" MIL kindly stepped off from that point on.\n> \n> I know racism doesn't go away, I just know if my kids did ever pick up something from her, Tom wouldn't be afraid to shut her up\n\n**Commenter 3:** NTA, MIL made her choice, said she changed but you see she hasn’t on FB, so she doesn’t deserve another chance. There is no endless chances clause, no auto forgive clause or the right to be included for anyone or family. If you don’t behave you don’t get to be included. When you get the chance tell MIL she can be grandma to Talia’s kids.\n\n> **OOP:** You're actually right! Talia made cryptic posts about my MIL being a 'bonus grammy' when she eventually moved on (this was on a Mother's Day post midway into Tom's and mine's relationship). Like, the flags were waving in my face, but I sucked it up back then since I didn't want to make waves. Kinda regret it but kinda don't, since it showed my character versus hers. I legit wanted to make it work smh\n\n**Commenter 4:** The best part of the story is how Tom is standing by you all the way, and seems relieved to not deal with his mom's bull.\n\nThe worst part is \"the daughter she always wanted\" when she has an actual daughter. MIL is a serious ahole.\n\nDo you really want her in your kids lives, for the brief period while she behaves, and then try to explain what happened to grandma when you have to shut her out again?\n\n> **OOP:** Good point, and yes, Tom and my SIL are godsends. SIL is an amazing aunt, she spoils my boys rotten! And so does my family! I don't need MIL in my life, I just felt (as a mom), being robbed of being a grandma would hurt. My confidence took a plummet postpartum, so I tend to overthink now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/16FfdNrdyL): **May 25, 2025 (eight days later)**\n\nOK! So, first off, thanks to everybody who supported me on my first post! I just wanted to clarify a few things, since I was in hysterics when I wrote the OG post and worded some things weirdly. \n\nFirst off, Tom didn't cheat on me. The timeline goes as followed: Tom and Talia were originally forced to hang out since childhood and Talia developed a crush, the two got together in 7th grade, Tom left for college and met me, we hung out (just PLATONIC) and had stuff in common (more stuff in common than Talia and he), he went home and broke things off with her, he asked me out the following week, and it took four dates before I actually started to view him as a serious potential partner. See, NO interlap of relationships, NO affair, NO reason for all those comments saying I was an AH for \"being the other woman\". \n\nAlso, thanks for the people who defended me against these people! And before anybody says \"you're being awfully defensive, you must have cheated\", I'm defensive because I view adultery as a crime nobody can come back from. In my culture, adultery is very common (I believe studies showed 55% of married Indians have committed it, and so it is a sensitive subject. Also to clarify, Talia is the one who wore the white dress to the Indian wedding, and (attempted to wear) the red dress to the American wedding. I know a few people were confused on that too!\n\n**So now on to the update!**\n\nWe have remained NC with MIL! \n\nAfter receiving a few more messages from that number, Tom and I formulated a reply that was along the lines of this: \n\n'Dear MIL, you have repeatedly showed you don't care about Tom and I's feelings regarding multiple things. I'm sorry if our relationship broke apart that fantasy you had with Talia being your DIL, but the fact is it wasn't going to happen. Talia has been a constant thorn in our relationship, both you and her have been passive aggressive, rude, oblivious, and snide in your remarks and actions towards us. You said you would refuse to come to the weddings if Talia was not invited, which you KNEW would make Tom look bad to my elders, who UNLIKE YOU, have since accepted him as one of our own. You allowed Talia to berate me, comment about me, joke about me, and if I ever tried to 'joke' back, you would say 'that's not nice, she was just joking'. Funny how 'jokes' were pretty one way in that house. You made it VERY clear that TALIA is 'the daughter you always wanted' hence why SIL cut contact when we did. The only reason your sons stay is because they know if they leave, then you'll die with no kids to mourn you, since you nitpick their wives now that I am no longer around to be the scapegoat. I have screen shots of everything between you and Talia, and texts from the both of you, mocking ones and threatening ones. If you try to come after me for grandparents' rights, I will get my attorney and I will make sure you keep your racist ass away from my family. With all do respect, please leave us alone. You were fine not talking to us before we had kids, maybe Talia can finally move on and give you grandkids. \n\nSincerely, the OP family'\n\nI then blocked their numbers and set all my socials to private. Tom did as well, and we have talked to family about going private and unfriending people who may have ties to MIL or Talia. Things have been quiet since then.

Hindsight is a thing, but why on earth he didn't step up and nip all of this in the bud yonks ago, is beyond me.\n\nAlso, am genuinely curious here, so no malice meant at all. :) but why is wearing white not ok to an Indian wedding?

However, we states no white and no red. White is typically worn at funerals in Indian culture, so I personally view wearing white (and all its off-forms) as someone wishing death to the relationship. That's just personal superstition. Also, Tom has defended me. He and his sister always put up a united front because Talia was deeply ingrained into the family dynamic. MIL is one of those 'church ladies' and Talia is also highly involved with the church, so every nook and cranny had a bit of Talia. It wasn't possible to totally cut her off, since at that point in time we wanted to keep his family in his life, we just had to prove I wasn't leaving. Now, we don't care, so no more MIL drama\n\n**Commenter 2:** I’m so glad that you don’t have to be nice to Talia or MIL anymore. But I think you are counting your chickens before they have hatched.\n\nIf Talia is really engrained in MIL’s church and is spending all her free time with MIL, who is undoubtedly telling her that she should just wait for you and your husband to fall out, then she is never going to meet someone else.

Within those three years, I've had twin boys, which has made my MIL try to get back in contact with me. There's a lot of history, but here's a brief summary of why Tom and I are NC, and it all revolves around Tom's ex, who we'll call Talia.\n\nSo, I am Indian American, and Tom is white. He comes from a pretty traditional family, and grew up in a \"small town\". Talia was MIL's best friend's daughter, and they were the small town romance everybody envied. \n\nHowever, upon meeting in college, Tom and I just clicked on a platonic level, and to be honest, I didn't even have feelings for Tom until four dates in. I guess you could say he had an \"emotional affair\", but he never did anything physically romantic until he broke up with Talia. Talia, of course, remained in contact with his family since she had been (according to MIL) \"the daughter she always wanted\". \n\nKeep in mind, Tom HAS A SISTER! But, Talia is more of a homemaker, while my SIL (who is an absolute ANGEL) and I had always been more career focused. Talia had been at every holiday, family gathering, and get together since the very start of the relationship, and at first I paid it no mind. I was civil to Talia because MIL made it clear Talia mattered to her, despite Talia's blatant distaste and disrespectful attitude towards me. That changed at my weddings.\n\nWe had two, and my parents footed the bill for both. The dress code was simple, aside from the obvious no white/wedding party colors rule, NOBODY was supposed to wear red. I am well aware that red means you slept with the groom, but more importantly, RED IS A BRIDAL COLOR IN MY CULTURE! I wore a red lehenga and saree to my Indian wedding, which she wore an \"eggshell\" (off white) dress to (keep in mind, white is worn at funerals to represent purity in my culture). That got my aunties and cousins talking, but I still had a blast since I really didn't care. I DID care when she showed up to the 'American ceremony' in a floor length, apple red gown with a slit going up the leg. It was a bridesmaid's dress, and it violated the dress code. \n\nMy SIL, along with Tom, went to tell her to change. She did leave after having a hushed argument and came back in a tea length green gown (I assume she just wanted to see if she could get away with it). Apparently, my aunties saw this too. Which meant Talia was subjected to stares, whispers, and backhanded giggle fits throughout my whole 'American' wedding. It made Talia feel embarrassed and she cried to MIL, who went to me and told me to \"keep my kind in line\". \n\nTo this, I crossed my arms and told her that maybe Talia should've stayed in her lane, that she knew not to wear red for multiple (but mostly cultural) reasons, and it wasn't my fault my family is shaming her. It isn't my fault she became canon fodder for my gossiping gaggle of a family (yes, I said those words since that is what my aunties are). Those were the consequences of her actions. Tom and SIL backed me up, and MIL left with Talia before dessert.\n\nThe next day there was a social media post from Talia, crying about how she was 'exiled' from her 'best friends' wedding because the bride was jealous. \n\nI made a post back, telling her that she wore red, knowing how inappropriate it was. How her 'best friend' is her ex, and to not sugar coat what she did. I then tagged my MIL in a separate post with screenshots of Talia's post and told her this was the last straw, and that I have been disrespected by Talia from the very beginning of my relationship, and that now that I was her DIL, she needed to keep Talia away from 'family events and holidays' since she doesn't respect my husband and I. I didn't care if they still went on weekly shopping sprees or spa days, just keep her away from Christmas and BBQ's. \n\nTalia removed her post after being publicly called out. MIL was good on this compromise until three years ago, after Talia came to Thanksgiving with a pie and a plastered smile, A THANKSGIVING THAT I WAS HOSTING. She said something along the lines of 'MIL invited me' and 'I wanted to make sure MIL can actually eat something, since I know you tend to cook ethnic food'. I slammed the door in her face, went over to MIL, and told her she could leave with Talia, who I just slammed the door on. \n\nTom looked at his mom, who had this deer in the headlights look. She tried to sputter excuses, and my FIL tried to defend my MIL, but Tom stood firm. He said they had lost access to him, and any extension of him, since they chose Talia. My in-laws (aside from SIL) left, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nFast forward to last week, I got a text from an unknown number, and it was MIL. She said she saw a picture of my boys from a mutual friend's post, and wanted to reconcile. She said she'd keep Talia away this time, and that ever since she got cut off, she's been in minimal contact with Talia anyway (her Facebook begs to differ). I told her as much, saying I knew BS when I smelt it, and \"she made her choice\". \n\nI told Tom about it, and asked if he missed his family. He shrugged, saying he doesn't care, and it's been relieving not having his mom around (he's the youngest son of three, so he was always the 'baby boy'). But, I have since received text from my BILs, their wives, and my FIL begging for a second chance.\n\nShe always wanted to be a grandma, and I do feel like I'm robbing her of a chance. Her other sons haven't had children yet, and SIL cut her off when we did. But, you can't undo nearly a decade of disrespect with wishes and wants. And Talia is still in the picture, so I'm skeptical about how long that promise will last. I feel like I'm being calloused, but there are so many stories I can tell about Talia's disregard for Tom's boundaries, and mine. And I don't want to welcome a storm into my house by opening up the gates.\n\nAITAH for telling my MIL \"she made her choice\" after she kept my husband's ex around?\n\nEDIT: since there seems to be some confusion, I want to clarify Tom did not cheat on Talia with me. Tom broke up with Talia after a few platonic hang outs with me. That is why I said you could call it an 'emotional affair' , because you could argue it was one: loosely. Tom only asked me out after he broke up with Talia, and I accepted after he confirmed via texts (he had broken up with her while visiting home for the weekend). There was no overlap between Talia's relationship and mine with Tom. So, for everyone who thinks I was 'other woman' and 'the reason my MIL hates me if because Tom cheated on Talia', no he didn't.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** INFO: Did you marry your husband or your BILs, their wives and your FIL?\n\nBecause your husband is relieved, but you seem to think you might be the asshole for not taking away that relief? It's just a weird thing to think you are an asshole for not being a bad wife.\n\n> **OOP:** It is mostly due to my overthinking, I just tend to overthink now (which really wasn't a problem before having kids). I once spent twenty minutes in the kitchen debating on if Tom thought my feet smelt post birth. Legit cried, and Tom had to hold me and assure me I didn't stink.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'\n\n> **OOP:** Tom actually snipped that talk in the bud post wedding, when I told him everything. Told her he would call her out if she ever spoke like that about my family again. I attended every gathering after my wedding, and my SIL and Tom acted as watch dogs. My MIL did attempt to \"joke\" about 'smelly Indians' at a Church potluck (I had brought butter chicken since I knew it was easier for their palettes). Tom said something like \"My wife smells great, can't say the same about you. No amount of perfume can get rid of all those cigarettes\" MIL kindly stepped off from that point on.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape' There is no endless chances clause, no auto forgive clause or the right to be included for anyone or family.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'\n\n> **OOP:** You're actually right! Talia made cryptic posts about my MIL being a 'bonus grammy' when she eventually moved on (this was on a Mother's Day post midway into Tom's and mine's relationship). Like, the flags were waving in my face, but I sucked it up back then since I didn't want to make waves. Kinda regret it but kinda don't, since it showed my character versus hers. I legit wanted to make it work smh\n\n**Commenter 4:** The best part of the story is how Tom is standing by you all the way, and seems relieved to not deal with his mom's bull.\n\nThe worst part is \"the daughter she always wanted\" when she has an actual daughter. MIL is a serious ahole.\n\nDo you really want her in your kids lives, for the brief period while she behaves, and then try to explain what happened to grandma when you have to shut her out again?\n\n> **OOP:** Good point, and yes, Tom and my SIL are godsends. SIL is an amazing aunt, she spoils my boys rotten! And so does my family! I don't need MIL in my life, I just felt (as a mom), being robbed of being a grandma would hurt. My confidence took a plummet postpartum, so I tend to overthink now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/16FfdNrdyL): **May 25, 2025 (eight days later)**\n\nOK! So, first off, thanks to everybody who supported me on my first post! I just wanted to clarify a few things, since I was in hysterics when I wrote the OG post and worded some things weirdly. \n\nFirst off, Tom didn't cheat on me. The timeline goes as followed: Tom and Talia were originally forced to hang out since childhood and Talia developed a crush, the two got together in 7th grade, Tom left for college and met me, we hung out (just PLATONIC) and had stuff in common (more stuff in common than Talia and he), he went home and broke things off with her, he asked me out the following week, and it took four dates before I actually started to view him as a serious potential partner. See, NO interlap of relationships, NO affair, NO reason for all those comments saying I was an AH for \"being the other woman\". \n\nAlso, thanks for the people who defended me against these people! And before anybody says \"you're being awfully defensive, you must have cheated\", I'm defensive because I view adultery as a crime nobody can come back from. In my culture, adultery is very common (I believe studies showed 55% of married Indians have committed it, and so it is a sensitive subject. Also to clarify, Talia is the one who wore the white dress to the Indian wedding, and (attempted to wear) the red dress to the American wedding. I know a few people were confused on that too!\n\n**So now on to the update!**\n\nWe have remained NC with MIL! \n\nAfter receiving a few more messages from that number, Tom and I formulated a reply that was along the lines of this: \n\n'Dear MIL, you have repeatedly showed you don't care about Tom and I's feelings regarding multiple things. I'm sorry if our relationship broke apart that fantasy you had with Talia being your DIL, but the fact is it wasn't going to happen. Talia has been a constant thorn in our relationship, both you and her have been passive aggressive, rude, oblivious, and snide in your remarks and actions towards us. You said you would refuse to come to the weddings if Talia was not invited, which you KNEW would make Tom look bad to my elders, who UNLIKE YOU, have since accepted him as one of our own. You allowed Talia to berate me, comment about me, joke about me, and if I ever tried to 'joke' back, you would say 'that's not nice, she was just joking'. Funny how 'jokes' were pretty one way in that house. You made it VERY clear that TALIA is 'the daughter you always wanted' hence why SIL cut contact when we did. The only reason your sons stay is because they know if they leave, then you'll die with no kids to mourn you, since you nitpick their wives now that I am no longer around to be the scapegoat. I have screen shots of everything between you and Talia, and texts from the both of you, mocking ones and threatening ones. If you try to come after me for grandparents' rights, I will get my attorney and I will make sure you keep your racist ass away from my family. With all do respect, please leave us alone. You were fine not talking to us before we had kids, maybe Talia can finally move on and give you grandkids. \n\nSincerely, the OP family'\n\nI then blocked their numbers and set all my socials to private. Tom did as well, and we have talked to family about going private and unfriending people who may have ties to MIL or Talia. Things have been quiet since then. I know Talia has seen the post, since she screen shot the post and sent it to Tom via one of those apps you can get a spare number through. He sent a few laughing emojis before telling her he knows about the post and blocking her. \n\nTom has always had my back like this, even if Talia was in the picture, he and SIL would do little things to show we were a united front. I know a lot of people gave Tom flack in the last post for not standing up for me, but keeping my MIL in check was like a circus act, and my aunties are gossips to their cores. \n\nOnce, during a family BBQ, Talia spilled cola on my sundress, and Tom 'accidentally' pour his water over her head while talking to SIL as they walked past. It was like a Cold War, and as of right now, we finally seem to be winning. I got a message saying that Talia coming to my weddings was comparable to Camilla going to Diana and Charles' wedding, and now that I look back at it, it kind of was!

The dress code was simple, aside from the obvious no white/wedding party colors rule, NOBODY was supposed to wear red. I am well aware that red means you slept with the groom, but more importantly, RED IS A BRIDAL COLOR IN MY CULTURE! I wore a red lehenga and saree to my Indian wedding, which she wore an \"eggshell\" (off white) dress to (keep in mind, white is worn at funerals to represent purity in my culture). That got my aunties and cousins talking, but I still had a blast since I really didn't care. I DID care when she showed up to the 'American ceremony' in a floor length, apple red gown with a slit going up the leg. It was a bridesmaid's dress, and it violated the dress code. \n\nMy SIL, along with Tom, went to tell her to change. She did leave after having a hushed argument and came back in a tea length green gown (I assume she just wanted to see if she could get away with it). Apparently, my aunties saw this too. Which meant Talia was subjected to stares, whispers, and backhanded giggle fits throughout my whole 'American' wedding. It made Talia feel embarrassed and she cried to MIL, who went to me and told me to \"keep my kind in line\". \n\nTo this, I crossed my arms and told her that maybe Talia should've stayed in her lane, that she knew not to wear red for multiple (but mostly cultural) reasons, and it wasn't my fault my family is shaming her. It isn't my fault she became canon fodder for my gossiping gaggle of a family (yes, I said those words since that is what my aunties are). Those were the consequences of her actions. Tom and SIL backed me up, and MIL left with Talia before dessert.\n\nThe next day there was a social media post from Talia, crying about how she was 'exiled' from her 'best friends' wedding because the bride was jealous. \n\nI made a post back, telling her that she wore red, knowing how inappropriate it was. How her 'best friend' is her ex, and to not sugar coat what she did. I then tagged my MIL in a separate post with screenshots of Talia's post and told her this was the last straw, and that I have been disrespected by Talia from the very beginning of my relationship, and that now that I was her DIL, she needed to keep Talia away from 'family events and holidays' since she doesn't respect my husband and I. I didn't care if they still went on weekly shopping sprees or spa days, just keep her away from Christmas and BBQ's. \n\nTalia removed her post after being publicly called out. MIL was good on this compromise until three years ago, after Talia came to Thanksgiving with a pie and a plastered smile, A THANKSGIVING THAT I WAS HOSTING. She said something along the lines of 'MIL invited me' and 'I wanted to make sure MIL can actually eat something, since I know you tend to cook ethnic food'. I slammed the door in her face, went over to MIL, and told her she could leave with Talia, who I just slammed the door on. \n\nTom looked at his mom, who had this deer in the headlights look. She tried to sputter excuses, and my FIL tried to defend my MIL, but Tom stood firm. He said they had lost access to him, and any extension of him, since they chose Talia. My in-laws (aside from SIL) left, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nFast forward to last week, I got a text from an unknown number, and it was MIL. She said she saw a picture of my boys from a mutual friend's post, and wanted to reconcile. She said she'd keep Talia away this time, and that ever since she got cut off, she's been in minimal contact with Talia anyway (her Facebook begs to differ). I told her as much, saying I knew BS when I smelt it, and \"she made her choice\". \n\nI told Tom about it, and asked if he missed his family. He shrugged, saying he doesn't care, and it's been relieving not having his mom around (he's the youngest son of three, so he was always the 'baby boy'). But, I have since received text from my BILs, their wives, and my FIL begging for a second chance.\n\nShe always wanted to be a grandma, and I do feel like I'm robbing her of a chance. Her other sons haven't had children yet, and SIL cut her off when we did. But, you can't undo nearly a decade of disrespect with wishes and wants. And Talia is still in the picture, so I'm skeptical about how long that promise will last. I feel like I'm being calloused, but there are so many stories I can tell about Talia's disregard for Tom's boundaries, and mine. And I don't want to welcome a storm into my house by opening up the gates.\n\nAITAH for telling my MIL \"she made her choice\" after she kept my husband's ex around?\n\nEDIT: since there seems to be some confusion, I want to clarify Tom did not cheat on Talia with me. Tom broke up with Talia after a few platonic hang outs with me. That is why I said you could call it an 'emotional affair' , because you could argue it was one: loosely. Tom only asked me out after he broke up with Talia, and I accepted after he confirmed via texts (he had broken up with her while visiting home for the weekend). There was no overlap between Talia's relationship and mine with Tom. So, for everyone who thinks I was 'other woman' and 'the reason my MIL hates me if because Tom cheated on Talia', no he didn't.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** INFO: Did you marry your husband or your BILs, their wives and your FIL?\n\nBecause your husband is relieved, but you seem to think you might be the asshole for not taking away that relief? It's just a weird thing to think you are an asshole for not being a bad wife.\n\n> **OOP:** It is mostly due to my overthinking, I just tend to overthink now (which really wasn't a problem before having kids). I once spent twenty minutes in the kitchen debating on if Tom thought my feet smelt post birth. Legit cried, and Tom had to hold me and assure me I didn't stink.\n\n> **OOP:** Tom actually snipped that talk in the bud post wedding, when I told him everything. Told her he would call her out if she ever spoke like that about my family again. I attended every gathering after my wedding, and my SIL and Tom acted as watch dogs. My MIL did attempt to \"joke\" about 'smelly Indians' at a Church potluck (I had brought butter chicken since I knew it was easier for their palettes). Tom said something like \"My wife smells great, can't say the same about you. No amount of perfume can get rid of all those cigarettes\" MIL kindly stepped off from that point on. There is no endless chances clause, no auto forgive clause or the right to be included for anyone or family.\n\n> **OOP:** You're actually right! Talia made cryptic posts about my MIL being a 'bonus grammy' when she eventually moved on (this was on a Mother's Day post midway into Tom's and mine's relationship). Like, the flags were waving in my face, but I sucked it up back then since I didn't want to make waves. Kinda regret it but kinda don't, since it showed my character versus hers. I legit wanted to make it work smh\n\n**Commenter 4:** The best part of the story is how Tom is standing by you all the way, and seems relieved to not deal with his mom's bull.\n\nThe worst part is \"the daughter she always wanted\" when she has an actual daughter. MIL is a serious ahole.\n\nDo you really want her in your kids lives, for the brief period while she behaves, and then try to explain what happened to grandma when you have to shut her out again?\n\n> **OOP:** Good point, and yes, Tom and my SIL are godsends. SIL is an amazing aunt, she spoils my boys rotten! And so does my family! I don't need MIL in my life, I just felt (as a mom), being robbed of being a grandma would hurt. My confidence took a plummet postpartum, so I tend to overthink now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/16FfdNrdyL): **May 25, 2025 (eight days later)**\n\nOK! So, first off, thanks to everybody who supported me on my first post! I just wanted to clarify a few things, since I was in hysterics when I wrote the OG post and worded some things weirdly. \n\nFirst off, Tom didn't cheat on me. The timeline goes as followed: Tom and Talia were originally forced to hang out since childhood and Talia developed a crush, the two got together in 7th grade, Tom left for college and met me, we hung out (just PLATONIC) and had stuff in common (more stuff in common than Talia and he), he went home and broke things off with her, he asked me out the following week, and it took four dates before I actually started to view him as a serious potential partner. See, NO interlap of relationships, NO affair, NO reason for all those comments saying I was an AH for \"being the other woman\". \n\nAlso, thanks for the people who defended me against these people! And before anybody says \"you're being awfully defensive, you must have cheated\", I'm defensive because I view adultery as a crime nobody can come back from. In my culture, adultery is very common (I believe studies showed 55% of married Indians have committed it, and so it is a sensitive subject. Also to clarify, Talia is the one who wore the white dress to the Indian wedding, and (attempted to wear) the red dress to the American wedding. I know a few people were confused on that too!\n\n**So now on to the update!**\n\nWe have remained NC with MIL! \n\nAfter receiving a few more messages from that number, Tom and I formulated a reply that was along the lines of this: \n\n'Dear MIL, you have repeatedly showed you don't care about Tom and I's feelings regarding multiple things. I'm sorry if our relationship broke apart that fantasy you had with Talia being your DIL, but the fact is it wasn't going to happen. Talia has been a constant thorn in our relationship, both you and her have been passive aggressive, rude, oblivious, and snide in your remarks and actions towards us. You said you would refuse to come to the weddings if Talia was not invited, which you KNEW would make Tom look bad to my elders, who UNLIKE YOU, have since accepted him as one of our own. You allowed Talia to berate me, comment about me, joke about me, and if I ever tried to 'joke' back, you would say 'that's not nice, she was just joking'. Funny how 'jokes' were pretty one way in that house. You made it VERY clear that TALIA is 'the daughter you always wanted' hence why SIL cut contact when we did. The only reason your sons stay is because they know if they leave, then you'll die with no kids to mourn you, since you nitpick their wives now that I am no longer around to be the scapegoat. I have screen shots of everything between you and Talia, and texts from the both of you, mocking ones and threatening ones. If you try to come after me for grandparents' rights, I will get my attorney and I will make sure you keep your racist ass away from my family. With all do respect, please leave us alone. You were fine not talking to us before we had kids, maybe Talia can finally move on and give you grandkids. \n\nSincerely, the OP family'\n\nI then blocked their numbers and set all my socials to private. Tom did as well, and we have talked to family about going private and unfriending people who may have ties to MIL or Talia. Things have been quiet since then. I know Talia has seen the post, since she screen shot the post and sent it to Tom via one of those apps you can get a spare number through. He sent a few laughing emojis before telling her he knows about the post and blocking her. \n\nTom has always had my back like this, even if Talia was in the picture, he and SIL would do little things to show we were a united front. I know a lot of people gave Tom flack in the last post for not standing up for me, but keeping my MIL in check was like a circus act, and my aunties are gossips to their cores. \n\nOnce, during a family BBQ, Talia spilled cola on my sundress, and Tom 'accidentally' pour his water over her head while talking to SIL as they walked past. It was like a Cold War, and as of right now, we finally seem to be winning. I got a message saying that Talia coming to my weddings was comparable to Camilla going to Diana and Charles' wedding, and now that I look back at it, it kind of was! Only, Talia will always be the ex XD.\n\nIf MIL or Talia does something, I'll be sure to come back! I got locked out of my account for 'suspicious activity' apparently the mods thought I was a bot lol. So hopefully it doesn't happen again! Thank you all for your support!\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Having read your prior post, I honestly think that the response you formulate with your husband, needed to come from him alone. Not because you don't have every right to speak up, but he needs to do a hell of a lot more to defend you. Hindsight is a thing, but why on earth he didn't step up and nip all of this in the bud yonks ago, is beyond me.\n\nAlso, am genuinely curious here, so no malice meant at all. :) but why is wearing white not ok to an Indian wedding? Obviously I know it is a faux pas here, but didn't know it was a thing in your culture?\n\n> **OOP:** Its not that its not ok, each bride is allowed to wear what colors they want. However, we states no white and no red. White is typically worn at funerals in Indian culture, so I personally view wearing white (and all its off-forms) as someone wishing death to the relationship. That's just personal superstition. Also, Tom has defended me. He and his sister always put up a united front because Talia was deeply ingrained into the family dynamic. MIL is one of those 'church ladies' and Talia is also highly involved with the church, so every nook and cranny had a bit of Talia. It wasn't possible to totally cut her off, since at that point in time we wanted to keep his family in his life, we just had to prove I wasn't leaving. But I think you are counting your chickens before they have hatched. Your MIL has total control of this woman.\n\nYou are doing exactly what you should be doing. Stay as far away from both of them as possible. And make sure you have CCTV cameras on your home.\n\n> **OOP:** We got cameras not long before the boys were born since our neighbor's car got vandalized. We have them all around the house and inside. So, needless to say, I understand the sentiment!\n\n**Commenter 4:** I'm so glad Tom found you and you two are living a happy, healthy life! Thank you also for putting your kids first over the toxic racism your MIL displays!\n\nTom was smart enough to overcome the programming and choose for himself. He's definitely a keeper!\n\nTalia's behavior makes it damn near impossible to give a shit, but imagine how fucked up Talia's life is. She's spent a lifetime being groomed by someone else's family.\n\nThere is irony in the fact that OPs culture is known for arranged marriages, but it's the white guy's family that is trying to force a relationship!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**": {

        "original_text": "Dear Mr.Dosanjh,\n\nYeah you heard it right \"Panjabi\". That's what you address yourself right? From Coachella to Met Gala to Jimmy Fallon? **Never bothered clarifying that you’re an Indian first, maybe because you were never even proud of being an Indian in the first place**, or at least acknowledging that the place which gave your birth, name and fame belongs to an Indian state named Punjab. Apologies, let’s stick with “Panjab”, spelled just the way Khalistanis prefer, nudging that subtle hint of separatism.\n\nBut now, you’ve suddenly remembered that you’re an Indian? Not because the backlash over your collaboration with Pakistani actress Hania Aamir (whose anti-India stance is no secret), stung your patriotic soul, oh no. **Initially, you and your PR machine were all swagger, mocking the critics** with a “jo ukhaarna he ukhaar lo, main apni marzi da maalik” vibe. It was only when the reality hit, when trends of boycotts and the potential axing from big projects like Border 2 loomed, that you dusted off the victim card with your emotional and self-pitying PR statements. Did the thought of your Bollywood career going up in flames finally jog your memory about the country that made you?\n\nLet’s talk about your favorite shield behind which you comfortably hide while self-victimising yourself: the turban and Sikhism. You’ve spun this narrative that the hate is because you’re a turban-wearing Sikh. Really? **Sikhism, born in India, thrives in India, where the largest Sikh population resides.** From celebs to actors to politicians to defense personnels, all proud turban-wearing Sikhs are among India’s greatest sons and patriots. \n\nCompare the above to your so-called “blood brother” nation,**Pakistan. How many Sikhs there have risen to even half your fame? How many have become a Manmohan Singh, a Harbhajan Singh or at least a washed out version of Daler Mehndi? Spoiler alert: zero.** Because in Pakistan, Sikhs aren’t exactly rolling in acceptance from their majority Muslim community. Yet here you are, cozying up to a country that barely acknowledges the community you claim to champion. And while we are at it, do check where one of the largest religion driven Sikh Massacre took place. (Answer: Rawalpindi which, coincidentally or not, is the hometown of your new favourite co-star Hania Aamir)\n\nLet's throw all the above arguments out of the window for a second and just try to keep in mind that you are a proud Panjabi. So, **have you spared a single moment to (at least) condemn Pakistan for trying to destroy Golden Temple, the holiest site in Sikhism, just a month ago?** \n\nOr perhaps a nod of appreciation for the **Indian Air Force, led by a turban-wearing Sikh, Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh,** which defended not just the Golden Temple but all of Punjab from the Pakistani military aggression? Silence, it seems, is your preferred response. \n\nHave to give it to Hania in this case though, who had the spine to publicly support her country and its forces, even though her conscience knows they are on the wrong side. **She chose her own country over her Bollywood dreams** and her future, something which you might never understand no matter how many more films you end up doing with her.\n\nLet’s cut through the BS, Mr. Dosanjh.

Restaurants advertise \"surprise bags\" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.\n\nI ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.\n\nWhen I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.\n\nMy girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.\n\nShe got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup.\n\nAnyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense:\n\n(1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined.\n\n(2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home\n\n(3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

        "original_text": "Let's cut through the calculated PR spin, the fake victimhood, and the emotional blackmail. It's time to put all the facts on the table about why the anger against Diljit Dosanjh isn't just justified, it's necessary.\n\nThis isn't just about one movie anymore. It's about a pattern of disrespect.\n\n# Part 1: The Undeniable Facts\n\n* **THE BAN IS POLICY:**  A ban on Pakistani artists, implemented by the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), has been the official industry stance since the  **2019 Pulwama terror attack**. It was a policy born from the blood of our soldiers. This is not a new or temporary \"tension.\"\n* **HE IS A PRODUCER, NOT A PAWN:**  Diljit Dosanjh is a  **co-producer**  of 'Sardaar Ji 3' through his own company, Story Time Productions. He is not a powerless actor fulfilling a contract. He is a key decision-maker with financial and creative control. He had the power to stop this. He chose not to.\n* **THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL & ESCALATING:**  The backlash is no longer just online comments.\n   * **Mainstream Boycott:**  FWICE has officially demanded he be  **DROPPED**  from major upcoming films like the patriotic  **Border 2**  and Imtiaz Ali's next project.\n   * **Industry Criticism:**  Fellow artists like  **Mika Singh**  have publicly called him out, demanding an apology and calling the betrayal shocking.\n   * **Film Shelved in India:**  The film 'Sardaar Ji 3' has been pulled from India entirely, a direct admission of their guilt and fear of the public's rightful anger.\n\n# Part 2: Every Lie & Excuse\n\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"We shot the film in February before tensions got bad.\"*  **The Truth:**  The ban has been in place for over five years. This was an arrogant gamble to defy a national policy, thinking you were big enough to get away with it. You weren't.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"He chose to work with an artist, not a politician.\"*  **The Truth:**  He chose to work with Hania Aamir, an actress who, after the Pahalgam attack, publicly condemned India's counter-terror strikes (\"Operation Sindoor\") as  **\"cowardly\"**  and an act of  **\"cruelty,\"**  and even  **mocked the Indian Army**. He didn't just collaborate with a Pakistani; he collaborated with one who openly spewed venom against our armed forces. This wasn't ignorance; this was a deliberate choice to align with an anti-India voice.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"The producers' life savings are at stake!\"*  **The Truth:**  Our soldiers' lives are at stake. Your financial risk, taken while knowingly collaborating with an anti-India voice and breaking a national ban, is your problem. Trying to emotionally blackmail the audience that enriched you is a new low.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I'm just an actor; I have to support my producers.\"*  **The Truth:**  You  **are**  the producer. Stop lying.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I'm being targeted because I'm a proud Sikh.\"*  **The Truth:**  The most disgusting defense. The Indian audience has celebrated stars of every faith. We embraced you. You are not being questioned for your faith; you are being held accountable for your actions. Using religion as a shield is a betrayal in itself.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I am a citizen of Mother Earth; art has no boundaries.\"*  **The Truth:**  It’s easy to spout globalist philosophy when you're insulated by the wealth and fame we gave you. Tell that to the families of soldiers killed by terrorists from the country you’re so eager to collaborate with. This isn't art; it's a business deal that spits on our collective grief.\n* **The Excuse (via Interview):**  Choosing to justify himself in a \"safe\" interview with a journalist known for downplaying the 26/11 attacks shows pure cowardice. He didn't have the guts to face the people who made him, because he knows he let us down.\n\n# Part 3: Final Word – A Final FAQ for the Apologists\n\nThis is for anyone still defending him.\n\n**Q: \"What about our shared Punjabi culture?\"**  **A:**  The Line of Control is a real border paid for in blood, not a suggestion. When that border is crossed by terrorists, our shared culture becomes irrelevant. The nation comes first.\n\n**Q: \"You can't blame him for Hania Aamir's personal opinions!\"**  **A:**  Yes, we can. He chose to give his platform, his money, and his stamp of approval to someone who publicly condemned and mocked our army. He chose to endorse her. Her opinions are now his problem.\n\n**Q: \"He made us proud at Coachella!\"**  **A:**  That's what makes this a  **backstabbing**. We poured out our love and support to put him on that global stage. He took that love, that fame, and used it to turn his back on us and align with someone who mocks our soldiers. That’s not an excuse; that’s the heart of the betrayal.\n\n**Q: \"This is just hate. You should separate art from politics.\"**  **A:**  This isn't hate; it's hurt and disgust. It's the anger of a loyal audience that feels used. He is the one who chose to mix his business with an anti-India voice. We are simply reacting to it.\n\n**Update:**\n\nFinal point for everyone reading: Keep this focused. This is not a political or religious debate. This is about accountability for the facts laid out above. Period.\n\nMy criticism is sharp because I supported him so much. I was a long time fan. That’s what makes this kind of blatant disrespect so infuriating. I sincerely hope he listens to the audience that built him and makes this right, but that starts with acknowledging the truth. Don't cloud it with noise.",

He chose not to.\n* **THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL & ESCALATING:**  The backlash is no longer just online comments.\n   * **Mainstream Boycott:**  FWICE has officially demanded he be  **DROPPED**  from major upcoming films like the patriotic  **Border 2**  and Imtiaz Ali's next project.\n   * **Industry Criticism:**  Fellow artists like  **Mika Singh**  have publicly called him out, demanding an apology and calling the betrayal shocking.\n   * **Film Shelved in India:**  The film 'Sardaar Ji 3' has been pulled from India entirely, a direct admission of their guilt and fear of the public's rightful anger.\n\n# Part 2: Every Lie & Excuse\n\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"We shot the film in February before tensions got bad.\"*  **The Truth:**  The ban has been in place for over five years. This was an arrogant gamble to defy a national policy, thinking you were big enough to get away with it. You weren't.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"He chose to work with an artist, not a politician.\"*  **The Truth:**  He chose to work with Hania Aamir, an actress who, after the Pahalgam attack, publicly condemned India's counter-terror strikes (\"Operation Sindoor\") as  **\"cowardly\"**  and an act of  **\"cruelty,\"**  and even  **mocked the Indian Army**. He didn't just collaborate with a Pakistani; he collaborated with one who openly spewed venom against our armed forces. This wasn't ignorance; this was a deliberate choice to align with an anti-India voice.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"The producers' life savings are at stake!\"*  **The Truth:**  Our soldiers' lives are at stake. Your financial risk, taken while knowingly collaborating with an anti-India voice and breaking a national ban, is your problem. Trying to emotionally blackmail the audience that enriched you is a new low.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I'm just an actor; I have to support my producers.\"*  **The Truth:**  You  **are**  the producer. Stop lying.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I'm being targeted because I'm a proud Sikh.\"*  **The Truth:**  The most disgusting defense. The Indian audience has celebrated stars of every faith. We embraced you. You are not being questioned for your faith; you are being held accountable for your actions. Using religion as a shield is a betrayal in itself.\n* **The Excuse:**  *\"I am a citizen of Mother Earth; art has no boundaries.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape' This isn't art; it's a business deal that spits on our collective grief.\n* **The Excuse (via Interview):**  Choosing to justify himself in a \"safe\" interview with a journalist known for downplaying the 26/11 attacks shows pure cowardice. He didn't have the guts to face the people who made him, because he knows he let us down.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'\n\n**Q: \"What about our shared Punjabi culture?\"**  **A:**  The Line of Control is a real border paid for in blood, not a suggestion. When that border is crossed by terrorists, our shared culture becomes irrelevant. The nation comes first.\n\n**Q: \"You can't blame him for Hania Aamir's personal opinions!\"**  **A:**  Yes, we can. He chose to give his platform, his money, and his stamp of approval to someone who publicly condemned and mocked our army. He chose to endorse her. Her opinions are now his problem.\n\n**Q: \"He made us proud at Coachella!\"**  **A:**  That's what makes this a  **backstabbing**. We poured out our love and support to put him on that global stage. He took that love, that fame, and used it to turn his back on us and align with someone who mocks our soldiers.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'\n\n**Q: \"This is just hate. You should separate art from politics.\"**  **A:**  This isn't hate; it's hurt and disgust. It's the anger of a loyal audience that feels used. He is the one who chose to mix his business with an anti-India voice. We are simply reacting to it.\n\n**Update:**\n\nFinal point for everyone reading: Keep this focused. This is not a political or religious debate. This is about accountability for the facts laid out above. Period.\n\nMy criticism is sharp because I supported him so much.

The author isn't on Reddit but gave permission for me to share the full text here (2,527 words). You can find the original on the Lorehounds website and hear the author discuss these ideas on The Lorehounds' Alien: Earth Episode 4 podcast.`\n\nRecording our latest episode breakdown of Alien: Earth Ep 4, David raised an intriguing question: how do we reconcile the corporate dominated world we see in 2120 with the seemingly government controlled Colonial Marines sporting US flags in Aliens over 50 years later? On the surface, it seems like a potential continuity error, surely Noah Hawley, a devoted fan of the franchise, wouldn't make such a rookie mistake?\n\nBut the more I've dug into this apparent contradiction, the more I'm convinced it's not an error at all. Instead, it represents a sophisticated exploration of power dynamics through a science fiction universe, one that draws from real historical precedents and reflects the complex reality of how corporate and state power actually interact. The answer lies not in choosing between corporate or government control, but in understanding how they can become so intertwined that the distinction becomes meaningless.\n\n# The British East India Company: A blueprint for corporate dominance\n\nTo understand how the *Alien* universe might evolve from corporate rule to apparent government control, we need to look at history's most successful example of corporate imperialism: the British East India Company. Luke mentioned this connection on a previous episode, but it's worth diving deeper into just how perfectly this historical model maps onto what we're seeing in *Alien: Earth*.\n\nAt its peak in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the British East India Company was quite literally \"the largest corporation in the world.\" We're not talking about market capitalization or revenue, this company controlled territories, ruled populations, and commanded armies. The company's three presidency armies totaled about 260,000 soldiers, which at certain points was twice the size of the British Army itself. Think about that for a moment: a private corporation with a military force that dwarfed its home nation's official armed forces.\n\nThe company didn't just trade, it governed. It collected taxes, administered justice, minted currency, and maintained diplomatic relations with other powers. For over a century, vast swaths of the Indian subcontinent were ruled not by the British Crown, but by a joint-stock company accountable primarily to its shareholders. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is exactly what we see in *Alien: Earth*. The \"Big 5\" corporations; Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold, have stepped into the power vacuum left by a devastating war (*Head Canon Alert*: possibly the conclusion of the conflicts that began with battles like Tannhäuser Gate mentioned in *Blade Runner*). Like the British East India Company, these corporations aren't just businesses; they're quasi-governmental entities with their own territories, military forces, and administrative systems.\n\nBut here's where the historical parallel becomes really interesting: the British East India Company's dominance didn't last forever.\n\n# The Government strikes back: How nations reassert control\n\nThe crucial bit of history about the British East India Company is that the British government gradually reasserted control over its operations. This wasn't a sudden corporate takeover followed by an equally sudden government coup, it was a decades-long process of increasing oversight, regulation, and integration.\n\nThe process began with the Regulating Act of 1773, which established government oversight of the company's affairs. The India Act of 1784 went further, establishing government control of political policy while leaving commercial operations largely in corporate hands. By 1813, the company's commercial monopoly was broken, and from 1834 onwards, it was merely a managing agency for the British government of India, still operational, still profitable, but no longer truly independent.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin came after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The British government, citing the company's mismanagement and the need for better governance, effectively abolished the company and took over all of its administrative and taxing powers, along with its possessions and armed forces. The company's 24,000-strong military was absorbed into the British Army.\n\nThis historical precedent gives us a perfect template for understanding how the *Alien* universe could evolve from corporate dominance in 2120 to apparent government control by 2179, a span of 50+ years that provides ample time for this complex political evolution.\n\n# The modern parallel: Blackwater and the corporate-military Complex\n\nBefore we dive into how this might work in the Alien timeline, it's worth noting that we don't need to look to historical examples to see corporate military integration in action. Today's world already provides plenty of precedents.\n\nCompanies like Blackwater (now Constellis) sometimes designated as Private Military Contractors or PMC’s, have become deeply embedded in modern military operations. These aren't just suppliers or contractors in the traditional sense, they're parallel military organisations working alongside, and sometimes in place of, official government forces. By 2007, there were as many private contractors in Iraq as there were members of the military, fundamentally changing how we think about who actually fights America's wars.\n\nBut here's the key point: these contractors don't replace government forces, they integrate with them. Blackwater operatives wore official military gear and operated under government contracts, but they served corporate interests and followed corporate chains of command. The line between public and private military action became so blurred that in many cases, it was impossible to tell where government operations ended and corporate operations began.\n\nThis is exactly the model I believe we see in Aliens. The Colonial Marines aren't proof that corporations lost power, they're proof that corporate power became so integrated with government power that traditional military structures began serving corporate interests while maintaining the facade of government control.\n\n# A three-phase evolution: From corporate rule to hybrid control\n\nBased on the historical precedent of the British East India Company and the modern reality of corporate military integration, I propose a three phase evolution for the Alien timeline that unfolds over nearly six decades, this is just my take so take it with a very large pinch of salt:\n\n**Phase 1: Corporate Ascendancy (2115-2130)** This is what we see in Alien: Earth. Following a devastating war, (again just my head canon) likely the final phase of conflicts that began with Tannhäuser Gate, traditional nation states are financially and militarily exhausted. The \"Big 5\" corporations step in to fill the power vacuum, becoming quasi governmental entities with their own military forces, territories, and administrative systems. Like the British East India Company at its peak, these corporations don't just dominate commerce, they effectively govern.\n\nThe war Joe Hermit references in Episode 4 could be this final conflict, where nation states made one last attempt to reassert control over corporate power and lost decisively. With governments bankrupt and their militaries depleted, corporations became the only entities capable of maintaining order, providing security, and managing the complex logistics of interstellar civilisation.\n\n**Phase 2: Government Reassertion and Integration (2130-2160)** This is the crucial transitional period that we don't see directly in the franchise but which explains how we get from corporate rule to the hybrid system we see in Aliens. Following the British East India Company model, governments begin to gradually reassert control, not by displacing the corporations, but by integrating with them.\n\nThis process likely begins with oversight and regulation. Perhaps there's a Colonial Authority established to provide government supervision of corporate activities. Maybe there are new treaties or agreements that formalise the relationship between corporate territories and traditional nation states. The key is that rather than dismantling corporate power, governments co-opt it.\n\nCorporate military forces aren't disbanded, they're integrated into new hybrid command structures. Corporate territories, such as planets, moons and colonies, don't become independent nations, they become special administrative regions or corporate protectorates under loose government oversight. The corporations remain powerful, but they're no longer truly independent actors.\n\n**Phase 3: Mature Hybrid System (2160-2179)** By the time of Aliens, we see the mature version of this hybrid system. The Colonial Marines wear US flags and operate under apparent government authority, but their missions, equipment, and strategic priorities are heavily influenced by corporate interests. They're not corporate armies that have been nationalised, they're government forces that have been thoroughly corporatised.\n\nThis is why Weyland-Yutani can so easily manipulate the mission in Aliens. They're not operating outside government authority, they've become so integrated with government authority that they can direct it from within. Burke isn't a rogue corporate agent working against the military, he's a corporate representative working through official channels that corporations help control.\n\nThe company's ability to sacrifice the Marines doesn't stem from replacing the government, but from having become so integrated with it that the distinction becomes meaningless. When the corporate masters order the Marines into danger or Burke manipulates their mission parameters, they’re not defying government authority, they’re exercising it through corporate controlled channels.\n\n# The sinister implications: Corporate power through government channels\n\nThis evolutionary model actually makes the corporate villainy in Aliens even more sinister than a simple corporate takeover would. If Weyland-Yutani had simply replaced government authority, their actions would be clearly illegitimate and could potentially be challenged or overturned. But by working through official government channels that they help control, their actions carry the full weight and legitimacy of state power.\n\nWhen the Colonial Marines follow orders that serve corporate interests, they're not being manipulated by outside forces, they're following legitimate military commands that happen to have been shaped by corporate influence. When Burke makes decisions that prioritise company profits over Marine lives, he's not defying authority, he's exercising authority that has been structured to serve corporate interests.\n\nThis is the ultimate expression of corporate power: not the replacement of government, but the transformation of government into an extension of corporate will. It's more stable than pure corporate rule (because it maintains the legitimacy of traditional institutions) and more effective (because it can deploy the full resources of the state in service of corporate interests).\n\n# The Historical Precedent in Action\n\nThe beauty of this model is that it has real historical precedent. The transition from British East India Company rule to British Raj wasn't the end of corporate influence in India, it was the beginning of a new phase where corporate interests were pursued through official government channels. The company's shareholders didn't lose their investments; they simply changed from direct corporate governance to indirect influence through government policy.\n\nMany of the same people who had run the company simply transitioned to running the government administration. The same economic interests were served, but now with the full legitimacy and resources of the British state behind them. Corporate influence didn't disappear, it evolved into a more sophisticated and sustainable form.\n\n# Modern echoes: The Military-Industrial complex\n\nWe can see similar dynamics in our own world through what Eisenhower famously called the \"military-industrial complex.\" Defense contractors don't replace the military, they become so integrated with it that military and corporate interests align. Pentagon officials move to defense contractors, and corporate executives move to government positions. The result is a system where corporate interests are pursued through official government channels.\n\nThis is why Boeing or Lockheed Martin don't need to have their own armies, they can influence government military policy to serve their interests while maintaining the legitimacy and resources that come with official government authority. Corporate power is most effective when it works through, rather than against, governmental structures.\n\n# Why This Matters for Understanding Alien: Earth\n\nUnderstanding this evolutionary model helps us appreciate what Noah Hawley is really doing with *Alien: Earth*. He's not just showing us corporate bad guys, he's exploring how corporate power actually works in the real world. The \"Big 5\" corporations in 2120 aren't cartoon villains who've somehow convinced everyone to let them take over. They're sophisticated political and economic actors who've stepped into a power vacuum and are in the process of transforming the very nature of governance itself.\n\nThe “Lost Boys” we see in the show, Wendy, Slightly, the other hybrids, are growing up in a world where corporate authority is the only authority they've ever known. They don't see themselves as living under corporate rule because corporate rule has become the natural order of things. This isn't dystopian science fiction, it's a sophisticated exploration of how power actually evolves and legitimises itself and this is just one layer in a show of many!\n\nBy 2179, when the Colonial Marines drop onto LV-426, they're not rebels fighting against corporate oppression, they're professional soldiers serving what they believe to be legitimate government authority. The fact that this authority has been shaped by corporate interests doesn't make their service any less genuine or their sacrifice any less real. It makes the corporate manipulation of their mission all the more tragic.\n\n# The long view: Power, legitimacy, and evolution\n\nWhat makes the *Alien* universe's treatment of corporate power so sophisticated is that it recognizes something many science fiction stories miss: power doesn't usually change hands through dramatic coups or sudden reversals. It evolves gradually, adapting to new circumstances while maintaining continuity with existing structures.\n\nThe corporations in *Alien: Earth* aren't trying to destroy government, they're trying to become government. And by the time of *Aliens*, they've largely succeeded, but in a way that preserves the forms and legitimacy of traditional state power while directing it toward corporate ends.\n\nThis is why the Colonial Marines can wear US flags while serving corporate interests, why Burke can manipulate military operations while claiming government authority, and why the company can sacrifice Marines while maintaining the moral high ground of \"following orders\" and \"serving the greater good.\"\n\nIt's a chilling vision of how corporate power might actually evolve, not through dramatic takeover, but through gradual integration until the distinction between corporate and government authority becomes meaningless. The British East India Company shows us it's happened before. Modern military contractors show us it's happening now. The *Alien* universe shows us where it might lead.\n\nIn the end, the question isn't whether corporations or governments are in charge, it's whether there's any meaningful difference left between them. And in the world of *Alien*, that distinction has long since been lost in the vastness of space, where the only authority that matters is the one that can get you home alive... or ensure that you never make it back at all.\n\nThe perfect organism, indeed. But maybe the real perfect organism isn't the Xenomorph, maybe it's the corporate-state hybrid that created the conditions for their discovery in the first place. After all, what could be more perfectly adapted for survival than a power structure that feeds on crisis, grows stronger through conflict, and evolves constantly to meet new challenges?\n\nIn space, no one can hear you scream. But on Earth, in boardrooms and government offices, in the quiet conversations between corporate executives and military commanders, the real monsters are making the decisions that will echo through the stars for generations to come.\n\nThe long walk into the unknown isn't just about individual characters facing the void, it's about entire civilizations walking into futures they may not recognize, guided by powers they no longer fully understand or control. And sometimes, the most terrifying monsters are the ones wearing suits and carrying briefcases, speaking softly about quarterly profits and strategic objectives while the galaxy burns around them.\n\nWelcome to the corporate future. Mind the gap.",

The company's shareholders didn't lose their investments; they simply changed from direct corporate governance to indirect influence through government policy.\n\nMany of the same people who had run the company simply transitioned to running the government administration. The same economic interests were served, but now with the full legitimacy and resources of the British state behind them. Corporate influence didn't disappear, it evolved into a more sophisticated and sustainable form.\n\n# Modern echoes: The Military-Industrial complex\n\nWe can see similar dynamics in our own world through what Eisenhower famously called the \"military-industrial complex.\" Defense contractors don't replace the military, they become so integrated with it that military and corporate interests align. Pentagon officials move to defense contractors, and corporate executives move to government positions. The result is a system where corporate interests are pursued through official government channels.\n\nThis is why Boeing or Lockheed Martin don't need to have their own armies, they can influence government military policy to serve their interests while maintaining the legitimacy and resources that come with official government authority. Corporate power is most effective when it works through, rather than against, governmental structures.\n\n# Why This Matters for Understanding Alien: Earth\n\nUnderstanding this evolutionary model helps us appreciate what Noah Hawley is really doing with *Alien: Earth*. He's not just showing us corporate bad guys, he's exploring how corporate power actually works in the real world. The \"Big 5\" corporations in 2120 aren't cartoon villains who've somehow convinced everyone to let them take over. They're sophisticated political and economic actors who've stepped into a power vacuum and are in the process of transforming the very nature of governance itself.Translation error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape' They don't see themselves as living under corporate rule because corporate rule has become the natural order of things. This isn't dystopian science fiction, it's a sophisticated exploration of how power actually evolves and legitimises itself and this is just one layer in a show of many!\n\nBy 2179, when the Colonial Marines drop onto LV-426, they're not rebels fighting against corporate oppression, they're professional soldiers serving what they believe to be legitimate government authority. The fact that this authority has been shaped by corporate interests doesn't make their service any less genuine or their sacrifice any less real. It makes the corporate manipulation of their mission all the more tragic.\n\n# The long view: Power, legitimacy, and evolution\n\nWhat makes the *Alien* universe's treatment of corporate power so sophisticated is that it recognizes something many science fiction stories miss: power doesn't usually change hands through dramatic coups or sudden reversals. It evolves gradually, adapting to new circumstances while maintaining continuity with existing structures.\n\nThe corporations in *Alien: Earth* aren't trying to destroy government, they're trying to become government. And by the time of *Aliens*, they've largely succeeded, but in a way that preserves the forms and legitimacy of traditional state power while directing it toward corporate ends.\n\nThis is why the Colonial Marines can wear US flags while serving corporate interests, why Burke can manipulate military operations while claiming government authority, and why the company can sacrifice Marines while maintaining the moral high ground of \"following orders\" and \"serving the greater good.\"\n\nIt's a chilling vision of how corporate power might actually evolve, not through dramatic takeover, but through gradual integration until the distinction between corporate and government authority becomes meaningless. The British East India Company shows us it's happened before. Modern military contractors show us it's happening now. The *Alien* universe shows us where it might lead.\n\nIn the end, the question isn't whether corporations or governments are in charge, it's whether there's any meaningful difference left between them. And in the world of *Alien*, that distinction has long since been lost in the vastness of space, where the only authority that matters is the one that can get you home alive... or ensure that you never make it back at all.\n\nThe perfect organism, indeed. But maybe the real perfect organism isn't the Xenomorph, maybe it's the corporate-state hybrid that created the conditions for their discovery in the first place. After all, what could be more perfectly adapted for survival than a power structure that feeds on crisis, grows stronger through conflict, and evolves constantly to meet new challenges?\n\nIn space, no one can hear you scream. But on Earth, in boardrooms and government offices, in the quiet conversations between corporate executives and military commanders, the real monsters are making the decisions that will echo through the stars for generations to come.\n\nThe long walk into the unknown isn't just about individual characters facing the void, it's about entire civilizations walking into futures they may not recognize, guided by powers they no longer fully understand or control. And sometimes, the most terrifying monsters are the ones wearing suits and carrying briefcases, speaking softly about quarterly profits and strategic objectives while the galaxy burns around them.\n\nWelcome to the corporate future.

        "original_text": "And when I say I want to, people start protesting \"You hate your country haww, so you are just wasting our resources?\" Bitch I pay for them\n\nYou want to know why I want to leave? You want to act like questioning the state of things makes me some kind of traitor? Fine. Let's go step by step because apparently, blind patriotism is easier than confronting reality.\n\nLet’s start with the latest outrage—the Supreme Court telling Ranveer Allahbadia that his jokes would \"make women feel ashamed.\" Oh, so now we care about women’s dignity? When it’s about a guy cracking jokes, suddenly the system wants to step in and be the moral police. But when it’s about something that actually matters—marital rape? Silence. Absolute, deafening silence. You know what’s legal here? A man forcing himself on his wife, because apparently, marriage is a free pass for assault. But sure, let’s focus on jokes. Let’s spend our time on the big issues like comedy instead of, I don’t know, the fact that rapists walk free, that women have to beg for justice, that survivors are shamed while criminals get sympathy.\n\nAnd since we’re talking about priorities, let’s talk about law and order in general. Every week, a new case of some rich, powerful guy committing a crime and getting away with it. Drunk drivers mowing down people? Political connections will fix it. A celebrity gets caught doing something illegal? Don’t worry, a PR campaign will clear their image. A regular person, though? Get ready to rot in the system. There’s no justice here—just a game where the rich and connected win, and the rest of us pretend we live in a functioning democracy.\n\nBut let’s not stop there. Let’s talk about the culture—because this country prides itself on being “progressive” while clinging to ideas that should’ve died centuries ago. Ever since this Ranveer Allahbadia controversy, it’s been clearer than ever that we’re not moving forward—we’re stuck. Our definition of progress is adding more shopping malls while keeping the same regressive mindsets alive. Women still get judged for what they wear. Inter-caste or interfaith couples still get harassed. Parents still control their kids like they own them, shoving them into careers they hate because “log kya kahenge” (what will people say). And god forbid you question tradition—because the moment you do, you're suddenly disrespecting \"Bharatiya sanskriti\" (Indian culture).\n\nLet’s move on to infrastructure, or rather, the lack of it. My parents pay their taxes, but where does that money go? Because it’s sure as hell not going into roads. I don’t even live in some remote village—I live in a developed town. But apparently, \"developed\" means nothing, because the nearest McDonald's is 17 kilometers away. And sure, it’s not about McDonald's itself—it’s about how basic infrastructure is still a joke. Potholes, traffic that moves slower than a dying snail, and an internet speed that makes you question if you’re still in 2025 or if you time-traveled back to 2008.\n\nAnd then there’s education. A system that rewards memorization over intelligence. A system where creativity is crushed and students are pushed into engineering or medicine like cattle, with no regard for what they actually want. You’re not taught to think—you’re taught to obey. Schools don’t prepare you for life; they prepare you to be a replaceable cog in an overpopulated machine. And if you dare to dream outside the conventional path? Good luck explaining that to your family, because in their eyes, success is a government job or an IIT degree.\n\nThen we have the economy. Oh, you want to build wealth? Well, good luck, because if you're not born into it, you're in for a lifelong struggle. Wages are low, the cost of living is rising, and everything is taxed to death. Want to start a business? Get ready to drown in bureaucratic nonsense and corruption. Want to invest? Hope you enjoy government policies changing overnight, killing industries with zero warning. And if you somehow manage to make money, guess what? You’re still at the mercy of outdated financial policies and a stock market that swings like a drunk pendulum.\n\nAnd finally, the biggest hypocrisy of all—if I want to leave, suddenly I’m the villain? Suddenly, I “hate my country”? No. I don’t hate my country—I hate what it has become. I hate that questioning these things makes people defensive instead of introspective. I hate that people refuse to acknowledge reality because it’s easier to pretend everything is fine. I hate that I have to explain why wanting a better life isn’t a betrayal.\n\nBut sure, keep calling me ungrateful. Keep telling me that \"no country is perfect,\" as if that excuses everything. Keep pretending that patriotism means blind obedience instead of demanding better. And while you do that, I’ll be making my way to a place that values progress over empty pride.\n\n",
