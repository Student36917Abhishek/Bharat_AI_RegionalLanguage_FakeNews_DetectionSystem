The Turning Point USA leader said that now, she encourages young couples to not wait to have children. “Especially if you’re a young woman, don’t put it off. You can always have a career, you can always go back to work. You can never just go back to having children,” she said. “And they grow so fast and so quickly. I just, I was praying.

His suspected killer, Tyler Robinson, was arrested the next day and charged with murder. While the Kirks chose to keep their children’s faces off the internet, Kirk has spoken about how her children have dealt with the loss of their father. She said after she arrived home from escorting her husband’s casket back to Arizona, her daughter asked, “Where’s daddy. ”“I said, ‘Baby, daddy loves you so much,’” she recounted telling her daughter at the time. “‘Don’t you worry.

I want to eat a cupcake with ice cream and I want you to come home for a birthday surprise. ”Erika and Charlie Kirk were married in May 2021 after meeting in New York City in 2018. Following her husband’s death, Kirk was named the new leader of Turning Point USA as she vowed to carry on Charlie’s work to honor his legacy. “If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea,” Kirk said during a memorial broadcast of her husband’s podcast. “You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country. ” Why you can Trust the Irish Independent: Learn about Editorial Guidelines and AI Use Latest North AmericaNational Guard member dies after Washington DC attackLATEST | Trump vows to freeze migration from ‘Third World Countries’ after DC attack; one of the National Guard members shot diesFBI raids properties in terror probe after shooting of two National Guard members near White HouseTrump calls for Afghan refugees to be investigated after shootingLATEST | Trump calls for all Afghan refugees to be investigated after shooting of two National Guard members Two National Guard members are shot close to the White HouseTrump appears in public 40pc less than in first term and begins work day later‘Mini lightning’ on Mars shows atmosphere is electrically active, missionBrain worms, a family curse and division among political elites – meet the KennedysBREAKING | Two US National Guard members shot near White House in Washington DC; suspect in custodyShow more Top StoriesPolitics‘Great error of judgment’: Regina Doherty says it’s ‘hard to accept’ Ceann Comhairle’s explanation over Sinn Féin photo callIrish News‘Pause before you post’ – Irish advertisement on online safety and ‘sharenting’ goes viralCommentTanya Sweeney: If having a boyfriend is no longer Insta cool, is it finally OK to be a happily single independent woman.

Credit: Shawn Ryan Show/Youtube Charlie Kirk&#8217;s former head of security has finally weighed in on the alleged rumors that his team used &#8216;suspicious&#8217; hand signals just before the TPUSA founder was assassinated by a pro-trans leftist in Utah back in September. As The Daily Mail notes, footage of the shooting on social media showed two members of Kirk&#8217;s security team &#8216;awkwardly&#8217; adjusting themselves right before he was shot. This led some to believe the security guards were using hand signals. Some even thought they may have had foreknowledge of the attack. Here is the video footage in question: Brian Harpole went on Shawn Ryan&#8217;s podcast on Monday to speak out about that fateful day when Kirk was gunned down. When Ryan asked Harpole to respond to the &#8216;hand signal&#8217; rumors, the former head of security swatted them aside. &#8220;If we needed to relay a message, then we&#8217;d do it on comms; if we notice something, we&#8217;re not gonna use a hand signal,&#8217; he explained. Harpole went on to explain that any hand signal used would be definitive. &#8220;If you were to use hand signals&#8230;One, are those hand signals ones you would normally see during gesticulation, or are those definitive hand signals. &#8220;They&#8217;re definitive, so can&#8217;t be confused with a guy scratching his a**. WATCH: Harpole went on to tell Ryan that if anyone on his team was making a signal to other guards, they would instantly look to him for instruction regarding what to do next, which he says never happened prior to the shooting. &#8220;It&#8217;s not good communication,&#8221; he explained. As The Mail reports, Harpole added that he was bewildered when he first saw X users focus on a member of Kirk&#8217;s security team, Frank Turek, for simply &#8216;adjusting his hat. &#8217; &#8220;It&#8217;s like, okay, substantiate. So he touched his hat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were a line of people in the front and other people that did all kind of things, everybody&#8217;s subject to that. &#8221; Cullen Linebarger You can email Cullen Linebarger here, and read more of Cullen Linebarger's articles here",

Here's what we know Sneha Kumari | Nov 18, 2025, 09:40 IST ( Image credit : X | @PopBase | Candace Owens’ (L) Controversial Conspiracy Theory Linking Egyptian Planes to Erika Kirk (R) Sparks Heated Online Debate ) Candace Owens has sparked controversy with claims that Egyptian planes tracked Erika Kirk, relative of assassinated Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Owens alleges 73 overlaps between the planes and Erika’s flights, suggesting deliberate surveillance. Amid the backlash, rumors are circulating that Erika Kirk may consider filing a lawsuit against Owens and her husband. Candace Owens, former Turning Point USA member, has sparked controversy with new conspiracy theories following the assassination of the organisation’s founder, Charlie Kirk, 31, who was fatally shot at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025. Owens now claims that unusual Egyptian planes may have been tracking Erika Kirk, Charlie’s relative, rather than Charlie himself, a coincidence she says has occurred around 70 times over the past few years. Amid the speculation, rumours are circulating that Erika may file a lawsuit against Owens and her husband. Let’s find out. ( Image credit : X | @ScriptTrooper| Charlie Kirk (R) and Erika Kirk (L) ) Candace Owens claims Egyptian planes were tracking Erika KirkEarlier in October, Candace Owens made a bizarre statement about the most recent theory around an Egyptian Air Force plane departing from Utah, allegedly linked to Kirk’s assassination. However, Owens’ part has triggered a wave of criticism and backlash. Now, Owens claims that the unusual Egyptian planes were monitoring Erika Kirk rather than Charlie Kirk. She points out that one such plane’s path reportedly overlapped with Erika’s flights around 70 times over the past few years, a coincidence she describes as extremely unlikely. ( Image credit : X | @popbase | Candace Owens’ Viral Claims About Egyptian Planes Targeting Erika Kirk Draw Backlash ) Candace Owens has an explanation about the Egyptian planes In the now-viral video on social media, Candace Owens alleges that two Egyptian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft, identified by registration numbers SUBND and SUBTT, tracked Erika Kirk’s movements on 73 occasions between 2022 and 2025, with only 29 instances involving her husband, Charlie Kirk. Owens claims the chances of such repeated overlaps occurring randomly are virtually zero (&lt;0. 00000001%), asserting that these were not routine flights or exercises but deliberate surveillance operations across the U. She further suggests that this pattern has been deliberately suppressed and links it to Charlie Kirk’s unsolved assassination in September 2025, questioning the FBI’s statement that there are no solid leads. BREAKING:Candace Owens now believes the unusual Egyptian planes were actually tracking Erika Kirk and not Charlie. The Egyptian plane overlapped with Erika's flight travels about 70 times the past few years. That is a 0. 000000001% chance. This is actually mindblowing. com/YrjW5mxt0w— Evan Kilgore 🇺🇸 (@EvanAKilgore) November 17, 2025Netizens react to Candace Owens' recent findings As soon as the particular clip went viral, it quickly went viral and sparked debate. One X (formerly called Twitter) user, “Isn’t Erica’s dad the CEO of Raytheon in the Middle East. It’s very likely he had security on her for fear of kidnapping. ”“Someone pointed out that Erika was not in Utah that day, but the planes were. So they weren&#x27;t just tracking her,” another said. “Wouldn&#x27;t he have been tracking prior to 2022 if that were the case. Why Egyptian planes. &amp; wouldn&#x27;t her dad have the connections to have another set of eyes investigating this case. ”One said, “This would be more palatable if it came from a more attractive woman. Candace’s face is just too distracting. ” ( Image credit : X | @EvanAKilgore | Candace Owens Sparks Outrage With Claims Egyptian Planes ) Erika Kirk is rumoured to be considering legal action against Candace Owens Amid the growing controversy over Owens’ claims about Egyptian planes allegedly tracking her, rumours are circulating that Erika Kirk may file a lawsuit against Owens and her husband. The potential legal action could be in response to Owens’ public statements, which have drawn widespread attention and criticism, raising questions about defamation and the impact of spreading unverified claims. However, IndiaTimes cannot independently confirm the information, as it is based on the social media rumours.

Watch Below: &#8220;Like, what the fuck do we live in. Why do we have more humanity for people who are actually profiting off of killing Americans. &#8221; Schulz asked. The comedian&#8217;s co-host, Charlamagne tha God, then chimed in by using a moral high-ground flip, bizarrely warning Schulz not to &#8220;become&#8221; what he hates. &#8220;But you gotta be better,&#8221; Charlamagne said. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be like those people. Don&#8217;t become what you hate. &#8221; A seemingly confused Schulz then asked, &#8220;What do you mean. &#8221; &#8220;I hate people trying to kill Americans,&#8221; Schulz added. &#8220;So if you&#8217;re trying to kill Charlie Kirk, or if you&#8217;re trying to bring Fentanyl in here, I hate both of y&#8217;all. &#8221; Charlamagne then deflected the core moral inconsistency Schulz pointed out by shifting to a principle-based counterargument that sounded relevant, but actually reframed the entire conversation. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Charlie Kirk should have been killed for, you know, his rhetoric. And I don&#8217;t think that the people in these boats should be killed if they&#8217;re smuggling drugs,&#8221; Charlamagne said as he redefined the stakes, introducing a strategic equivocation wrapped in a red herring. Schulz then asked, &#8220;So what is the punishment for someone trying to bring fentanyl into the country. &#8221; to which Charlamagne replied, &#8220;I would think you just run down on them and fucking arrest them.
