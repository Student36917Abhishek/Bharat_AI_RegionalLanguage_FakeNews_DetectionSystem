        "selftext": "I'm quite confused after looking at all the conflicting images on the internet regarding how much area was actually covered by the Maratha Empire at its greatest extent or peak. I found the first two images randomly, while the third is from Wikipedia, and the fourth is from the Maharashtra state board textbook.\n\nWikipedia and several other online sources claim that the Maratha Empire, at its peak, covered an area of around 2.5\u20132.8 million square kilometers. For comparison, the size of modern-day India is approximately 3.3 million square kilometers. The area controlled by the Marathas was indeed quite large, and I believe this estimate includes regions under their influence or vassal states as well. This makes the Maratha Empire the sixth largest in Indian history, including the Republic of India, which is quite an achievement given the highly volatile and unpredictable nature of 18th-century India.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, at its zenith, the Maratha Empire expanded from Punjab in the north to Hyderabad in the south and from Kutch in the west to Oudh in the east, bordering Oudh and Rajputana in the north. However, these geographic terms are somewhat vague and not very specific. There is also a famous Marathi saying that the empire stretched \"from Attock to Cuttack\" (\u0905\u091f\u0915 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u091f\u0915), i.e., from Attock in modern-day Pakistan in the northwest to Cuttack in the east, and from southern Kashmir to Tanjavur in the south. Additionally, a Wikipedia page about the Battle of Peshawar in 1758 mentions that the Maratha army, under Peshwa Raghunath Rao and allied with the Sikhs, defeated the Durranis and briefly captured Peshawar, making it the northwestern frontier of the empire.\n\nHow can these facts be reconciled to arrive at a factually accurate conclusion?\n"

They were decent rulers and ruled a considerable amount of subcontinent for a while, but lately politicians and Bollywood actors have disproportionately given excess weightage to the Marathas compared to the other glorious empires our nation has throughout it's 3000 year old history. \n\nWhy is Shivaji portrayed as a Ruler from a totally different league compared to other kings throughout history? What's the reason behind it? Why aren't excellent rulers from other parts of the nation as much in limelight than the Marathas? Anything other than \"Marathas were good and Mughals were bad\" comment would be appreciated. Asking in good faith."
