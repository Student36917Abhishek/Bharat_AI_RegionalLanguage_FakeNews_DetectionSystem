    "historical_evidence": "During its peak in the mid-18th century, particularly under the Peshwas, Maratha power extended significantly. Maratha forces did reach Punjab, even briefly capturing Peshawar (near Attock) in 1758. Their influence extended to Kutch in the west, and their raids and tributary demands reached into Odisha (Cuttack) and regions bordering Oudh in the east. In the south, Maratha presence included a kingdom in Tanjavur (Thanjavur) and significant influence over other southern states, including parts of the Hyderabad region. While direct control over 'southern Kashmir' was less defined, Maratha influence certainly extended into the broader northern Indian plains. The popular saying 'Attock to Cuttack' reflects this vast historical reach.",

In contrast, the Sikh Empire, primarily located in Punjab and Kashmir, was considerably smaller, typically estimated around 250,000-300,000 square kilometers.

The Sikh Empire, consolidated by Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century, was primarily based in the Punjab region, including Kashmir and parts of present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, with its maximal extent typically around 250,000 to 300,000 square kilometers. Therefore, the Maratha Empire was roughly 5 to 8 times larger, not just 4 times larger.",
