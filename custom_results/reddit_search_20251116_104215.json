I'm a student currently working on a website that founders, researchers and biotech investors can use to stay updated with the newest rising biotech startups globally. I know that there are websites like [labiotech.eu](http://labiotech.eu) that give out country-based reports on rising companies, but they rarely have filters and more advanced search options, and often only cover the details of the technology.\n\n  \nHonest opinion, would people use a website to find out about new biotech companies if it had a personal dashboard, more search options, and analysis of founders, funding rounds, patents etc. \n\nIf not, are there any frustrations you have about the way you get biotech news/search for companies?"

I want this to be a message to all startup founders: Don't give up on your company when the rough gets going. Make sure you explore all options, speak to mentors, knock on all doors, and get all the help you can get. Be patient and take mental breaks to release tension. Have hope and if your tech is solid and there is a proven product-market fit, then keep hustling. Be an optimistic realist. Do not oversell,or like most scientists do, under-sell. See things as they are without embelishing one way or the other. Honesty with investors goes a long way. \n\nI am still young in my startup career...but just wanted to share some of my learnings so far. "

For years, biotech felt like something only huge corporations or research backed ventures could touch. But now, you have got these smaller companies offering specialized products often directly online and some of them look professional.\n\nWhile I was looking around, I came across a few examples which one of them being Elite Edge Biotech. Their site looked surprisingly polished for a smaller operation. It made me wonder how these kinds of startups handle things like trust building, logistics and compliance without the kind of funding the big names have.\n\nIt seems like they are part of this broader wave of biotech businesses and science, focusing on transparency, brand identity and accessibility rather than just being hidden behind B2B lab networks."

All they have out is a preprint, in which it sounds like the only validation they did on their model was prediction tasks on portions of the data it was trained on.

        "selftext": "Full text: \n\nOn a Friday in August, Dominique Verhelle was fired over Zoom. Three days later, on a Monday, she realized it was the first time in her life without a job.\n\n“It’s my baby,” Verhelle said of NextRNA Therapeutics, the biotech startup where she had been CEO. “I created the company.”\n\nIn 2020, Verhelle left her job at Takeda Pharmaceutical to take a chance on commercializing research that began at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. NextRNA raised tens of millions of dollars, rented lab space in Brighton, and then, last year, entered into an agreement with the pharmaceutical giant Bayer to partner on new approaches to treating cancer.\n\nTo continue reading, please login or subscribe to Globe.com\n\nBut the biotech ecosystem began to deteriorate post-pandemic. Funding became scarce; Verhelle started to feel like she was spending all her time raising money. The lab space that NextRNA worked out of — which had once been bustling with scientists from other companies — felt increasingly empty.\n\nAnd the Bayer partnership, which included money from the drug company, came with a stipulation: NextRNA had to produce a specific package of data by July of this year.\n\n”Everybody gave the best of what they could do. Working weekends and working really, really hard,” says Verhelle.\n\nBut at a town hall in mid-July, Verhelle told them that the end had come. Though she was still enthused about the breakthrough possibility of the science, the team needed more time to work on the data. And Verhelle couldn’t drum up any more money.\n\nLike many small biotechs trying to survive, NextRNA was swept away, along with all 27 employees. (Verhelle says their science — which focused on a subgroup of RNAs that don’t make proteins — might still be advanced by Bayer.)\n\n\nIt’s just one example of the businesses and jobs that have been lost in the industry’s dramatic decline. During recent months, local companies including Kojin Therapeutics, Abata Therapeutics, and iTeos Therapeutics have shut down, and a slew of others have trimmed their ambitions (and headcount), threatening progress on everything from cancer to autoimmune disorders.\n\nIn August, pharmaceutical companies laid off 19,000 people, more than any other sector — up a stunning 142 percent from August 2024, according to the staffing firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas.\n\n“I’ve just got so many colleagues that are shutting down their companies or doing [reductions in force] or are not able to fund raise,” says Daphne Zohar, founder and CEO of Boston-based Seaport Therapeutics. “So you’ve got the ecosystem disruption of a huge amount of people who are going to be looking for work.” Plus, she says, “there’s so much knowledge embedded” in companies, and there’s often no good way to capture it.\n\nDeborah Dunsire, the former CEO of Millennium Pharmaceuticals who has spent more than three decades in biotech, says she’s never experienced an environment as tough as this.\n\n“We’ve seen downturns before,” she notes, but not a “biotech winter that lasted as long as this one has.”\n\nDunsire, who’s based in Wellesley and sits on the board of trustees of Northeastern University, says she’s watching “promising technologies and promising products ... just get shut down.” Sometimes those assets are picked up on the cheap, “but often they’re not. And so I feel that loss. You see founders who have worked maybe for five, six, seven years and really taken a scientific idea and got it to the place where there’s a product that can actually be administered to patients in clinical trials. But then they can’t finish the journey.”\n\nIn recent decades, Dunsire says, we’ve seen the advent of cutting-edge technologies, such as immunotherapies. But the road from concept to approved medication is long, and she worries that transformative medicines are not being funded in the way they once were.\n\n\nSo what exactly are we losing? Small companies have been working on a range of “promising therapies — whether it be for Alzheimer’s, oncology, cystic fibrosis,” says Brad Zakes, senior vice president of emerging companies and economic growth at the industry group BIO. Losing those efforts will make the drug pipeline thinner, and patients may see fewer breakthrough medicines in coming years. “That’s the real tragedy,” Zakes notes.\n\nExperts say this “biotech winter” is particularly acute because of the long list of uncertainties facing the industry.\n\nThere have been myriad changes at the FDA. The Trump administration — and the Biden administration before it — expressed interest in introducing price caps on drugs. And raw materials needed to make medicines are likely to rise, due to tariffs. (Though broad cuts to research funding will eventually impact biotech, the full effect will likely not be known for years.)\n\n“We are going to see unemployment in the industry be at a scary level for a while,” says Grace Colón, who has worked in biotech for decades, and has invested as a venture capitalist. “It’s going to be hard for a lot of people to find new, full-time positions. I think they’ll have to resort to consulting and contracting for a while.”\n\nDunsire says that Boston has “attracted talent from all over the world.” But, she warns, “if we are closing companies, we’re going to start to lose a complement of high-paying jobs. And people will then have to think about maybe leaving Massachusetts. I think every state with a biotech center will grapple with this, but it’s a big component of the Massachusetts economy.”\n\nDunsire is also deeply concerned about the ability of universities to nurture new ideas, given their financial strain. She cites the massive dislocation going on at Harvard, as well as at other schools. These are “challenges to foreign graduates coming into our PhD programs and master’s programs,” she argues. “That, I think, will affect the feedstock that enables discovery.”\n\nAt a time when biotech in the US faces headwinds, biotech in China is gaining strength. Traditionally, says Zakes, the US has been viewed as “the gem of the biotech industry.” But “what we’re seeing now is China is starting to pick up the slack and do a very good job at creating an environment where things can be done quickly, efficiently, and relatively inexpensively. And we have to be mindful of that.”\n\nVerhelle, the former NextRNA CEO, felt strongly about paying her workers severance, so she wound down the company in a way that enabled her to do that. But she acknowledges that her former employees now have to tackle Boston’s tough biotech job market, a prospect, she says, that makes them “very worried.”\n\nVerhelle says she’s already thinking about her next company. But, she points out, she might assemble a smaller team this time and outsource more work.\n\nFour years ago, she says, if a young person asked her what they should study, she would tell them: “‘Oh, go into biology, go into chemistry. There is so much work there. You’re going to have a nice career.’ Now, I don’t think I would say that because I’m like: ‘Oh my God, I don’t know if you’re going to have a job in four years.’”"

        "selftext": "A recent investigative report by The Wall Street Journal describes how several biotech startups, backed by prominent tech investors such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, are pursuing human embryo editing despite widespread bans in the United States and many other countries. The article details how Armstrong allegedly proposed a “shock the world” strategy in which a venture would work in secret to create the first genetically modified baby and reveal its existence only after birth, forcing public acceptance through spectacle rather than debate.\n\nAccording to the report, the ambitions of these ventures extend beyond preventing disease to actively “improving” human traits such as intelligence, height, and eye color. One company employs an in-house philosopher who defends voluntary eugenics and has publicly contrasted their vision with historical state-sponsored programs, calling it “morally different.” At a private Manhattan event, this individual reportedly showed an image of a Nazi gas chamber used to kill people with disabilities to illustrate the supposed moral distinction.\n\nStartups including Orchid and Nucleus Genomics are already marketing unregulated “genetic optimization” software that screens embryos for probabilities of high IQ, height, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Their founders describe this as the beginning of a “neo-evolution.” Meanwhile, a company called Preventive—reportedly backed by Altman and Armstrong—has explored conducting embryo-editing work in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, where regulations are looser.\n\nExperts quoted in the piece condemn these initiatives as unsafe and ethically reckless. They argue that the technology is not ready for human application and could pass unintended genetic mutations to all future generations. One geneticist stated that the people behind these companies “are not working on genetic diseases” at all but on “baby improvement.”\n\n"
